# Moon Tribe (月の種族 / Kage / Shadows) - Tone Document

## Overview
The Moon Tribe (also known as "Shadows" / カゲ) are ethereal, immortal beings who were transformed by the comet's light long ago. They speak with a distinctive combination of feminine speech patterns, playful mischievousness, and ominous undertones. Despite discussing dark topics like death, destruction, and transformation, they maintain a lighthearted, teasing demeanor that creates an unsettling contrast.

## Core Speech Characteristics

### Feminine and Formal Speech Patterns
The Moon Tribe consistently uses feminine Japanese speech patterns throughout their dialogue:

- **わたくしたち** (watakushitachi) - Formal feminine "we"
- **あたし** (atashi) - Casual feminine "I"  
- **～わよ / ～わね** (wayo / wane) - Feminine sentence endings
- **～ですの / ～なのよ** (desuno / nanoyo) - Feminine explanatory endings
- **～だこと** (dakoto) - Feminine expression of emphasis
- **～ですわ** (desuwa) - Formal feminine copula
- **～ましょ** (masho) - Feminine volitional form

**Key Examples:**
- 「実はわたくしたち月の種族」("The truth is, we are the moon race")
- 「そうとも。お利口だけどまだまだ幼いぼうや。」("Exactly! You're clever, but you're still young, little boy.")
- 「あたしたちは時をこえて永遠に生き続ける…」("We continue to live in an eternity beyond time...")

### Collective Identity
The Moon Tribe speaks as a collective entity, consistently using plural pronouns:
- They say "we" (わたくしたち / あたしたち) even when appearing to be a single entity
- They shift seamlessly between formal わたくしたち and casual あたしたち
- Individual members seem to share consciousness or at minimum a unified perspective

### Distinctive Laugh
**クックククククク** (kukku kukukukukuku)

This laugh appears in nearly every interaction and serves multiple functions:
- Punctuates statements with an eerie, knowing quality
- Can be playful, ominous, or both simultaneously
- Often appears at the end of cryptic statements or instructions
- The repetitive "ku" sound creates a ghostly, inhuman quality

**Usage Examples:**
- 「クックククククク…もうじきこの世界もヤミにつつまれる。」("Mweheheheheheheh... Darkness will soon envelop this world, too.")
- 「クッククク…また会ったわね。」("Mweheheheh... We meet again, huh?")

## Tone and Personality

### Playfully Ominous
The Moon Tribe combines lighthearted, teasing speech with dark subject matter:

- They discuss death, transformation, and destruction in a casual, almost cheerful manner
- They enjoy games, riddles, and tests
- They tease Tim by calling him ぼうや (bouya - "little boy") in a somewhat condescending but not cruel way
- They speak of terrible things with an air of detachment, as befitting immortal observers

**Examples:**
- When introducing themselves, they make Tim guess what they are (cotton candy's relatives, bird-people, souls of the dead) before revealing the truth
- 「あなたを追ってくるかもよ。クックククククク…」("We may come to chase you later. Mweheheheheheheh...")
- 「今度の光でいったいなにが生まれることやら…」("What in the world will be born from its light this time…?")

### Ancient and Knowing
As immortal beings, they speak with the authority of those who have witnessed history:

- They reference events from 800 years ago and earlier as if they were recent
- They speak matter-of-factly about having witnessed the fall of the Incan kingdom
- They understand the comet's nature and purpose
- They position themselves as observers rather than participants

**Examples:**
- 「８００年ごとのすい星の接近は今度で４回目。その力をあびるほどヤミの力は強くなる…」("The comet approaches every 800 years; this is the 4th time. The Power of Darkness becomes stronger the more its power showers down...")
- 「インカ王国のほろびゆく姿もこの目でしっかりと見てきたわ。」("We also personally managed to see the kingdom of the Inca as it fell into ruins.")

### Cryptic and Riddling
They rarely speak directly, preferring hints, riddles, and vague instructions:

- They make Tim guess who/what they are
- They speak in metaphors ("lighter than air," "shadows where there is light")
- Their instructions are deliberately vague ("神の息のとどかぬところ" - "where the breath of the gods cannot reach")
- They enjoy the mystique of their nature

### Mischievous and Slightly Threatening
While not overtly hostile, they maintain an air of danger:

- They warn that angering them results in death
- They threaten to "chase" Tim if he doesn't help them
- They set up trials/tests with consequences
- They possess people's bodies (as seen in Chapter 28 with Neil's parents)

## Speech Pattern Variations

### Formal vs. Casual Mixing
The Moon Tribe freely mixes formal and casual speech, creating an otherworldly quality:

**Formal:** 「わたくしたち月の種族。またの名をカゲといいますの。」
("We're actually the Race of the Moon. We're also known as Shadows.")

**Casual:** 「あたしたちは時をこえて永遠に生き続ける…」
("We continue to live in an eternity beyond time...")

This mixing suggests they exist outside normal social hierarchies and conventions.

### Elongated Sounds
They occasionally elongate sounds for emphasis or to create a singsong, supernatural quality:

- 「こんばんわー、こんばんわー…お散歩ですかぁー？」("Gooood evening, gooood evening... Goooing on a stroll?")
- The repeated "ー" creates an eerie, drawn-out vocal quality

### Rhetorical Questions
They frequently use rhetorical questions to engage Tim while maintaining control:

- 「行く先をごぞんじない？」("Don't you know where to go?")
- 「わかったかな？」("Did you understand that?")
- These questions are often followed by tests or consequences

## Context-Specific Behavior

### First Encounter (Chapter 8 - Itory Mountains)
- Most playful and riddling
- Test Tim's worthiness through games and trials
- Establish their mysterious nature
- Set up the Incan idol quest

### Midair Garden (Chapter 18 - Nazca)
- More casual and helpful
- Still cryptic in giving directions
- Maintain their characteristic laugh and tone
- Less threatening than initial encounter

### Possession (Chapter 28 - Eurasia/Watermia)
- Most overtly dark and ominous
- Reveal they've killed and possessed townspeople
- Speak of the coming darkness
- Show their truly dangerous nature
- Still maintain characteristic laugh even while confessing murder

## Translation Considerations

### Maintaining Feminine Speech
English lacks direct equivalents for Japanese feminine speech patterns. To convey this:

- Use slightly more polished, refined vocabulary
- Employ rhetorical flourishes and poetic phrasing
- Consider using "we" consistently to maintain collective identity
- Avoid overly modern slang or masculine phrasing

### The Laugh Translation
クックククククク should be rendered with:
- Repeated syllables to match the Japanese
- A sound that feels both playful and sinister
- "Mweheheheheheheh" captures the right balance
- Keep consistent across all appearances

### Balancing Tones
The translation must maintain the unsettling contrast between:
- Light, playful speech patterns
- Dark, ominous subject matter
- Feminine, refined language
- Threatening implications

### Terms of Address
- ぼうや (bouya) → "little boy" or "young boy" - maintains condescending but not cruel tone
- Avoid "kid" (too modern/casual) or "child" (too formal)

## Key Thematic Elements

### Light and Shadow
They frequently reference the duality of light and shadow:
- 「光のあるところ必ずカゲがある。」("There are always shadows where there is light.")
- This reflects their nature as beings created by the comet's light

### Transformation and Change
They speak extensively about transformation:
- Their own transformation by the comet
- The transformation of other beings into monsters
- The cyclical nature of the comet's power
- The inevitability of change

### Timelessness
They exist outside normal time:
- They are immortal and unchanging
- They speak of centuries as if they were days
- They observe history rather than participating in it
- They have lost connection to normal human concerns

### The Comet's Nature
They are the primary expositors of the comet's true nature:
- It's a weapon from an ancient war
- It transforms living beings
- It cycles every 800 years
- It's connected to the Power of Darkness

## Sample Translations with Analysis

### Example 1: First Introduction
**Japanese:** 「ブーーーーーーーーーッはずれっ。実はわたくしたち月の種族。またの名をカゲといいますの。」

**Translation:** "Bzzzzzzzzzt... Wrong…! We're actually the Race of the Moon. We're also known as Shadows."

**Analysis:** 
- Elongated "Bzzt" sound captures the playful, gameshow-like quality
- "We're actually" maintains casual revelation tone
- "We're also known as" keeps formal-yet-friendly register
- Feminine quality maintained through phrasing choices

### Example 2: Trial Introduction
**Japanese:** 「この化け物たちを４０秒以内に消し去ることができたならインカの神像をさしあげましょう。クックククククク…」

**Translation:** "If you can exterminate these monsters within 40 seconds, we'll give you the Incan idol. Mweheheheheheheh..."

**Analysis:**
- "Exterminate" is more refined than "kill"
- "We'll give you" maintains collective voice
- Sets up game/trial with clear rules
- Laugh at end adds ominous undertone to what seems like a fair deal

### Example 3: Possession Reveal
**Japanese:** 「クックククククク…もうじきこの世界もヤミにつつまれる。さっきの体の持ち主は礼拝堂の地下で骨となってねむっているよ。」

**Translation:** "Mweheheheheheheh... Darkness will soon envelop this world, too. The owners of the bodies we were just using have become bones sleeping in the basement of the chapel."

**Analysis:**
- Opens with laugh, establishing tone before dark revelation
- "envelop" is poetic/refined word choice
- "we were just using" is casual about horrific act
- "have become bones sleeping" uses gentle euphemism for murder
- Contrast between refined language and horrific content creates unsettling effect

## Conclusion

The Moon Tribe's voice is one of the most distinctive in the game. They represent ancient, unknowable beings who exist outside human morality and time. Their speech must balance multiple contrasts: feminine yet ageless, playful yet ominous, refined yet threatening. Getting their voice right is essential for maintaining the game's atmosphere and the unsettling nature of these encounters. They should never sound fully human, but they should also never lose their playful, teasing quality—even (or especially) when discussing death and darkness.
