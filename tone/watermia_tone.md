# Watermia Tone Document

## Overview
Watermia (ウォータミア, "Water Capital" or "Floating City") presents a striking duality: surface beauty masking darker undertones. This chapter arc spans the party's arrival, Rob's emotional journey, and the disturbing Russian Glass gambling game. The tone oscillates between romantic tenderness, domestic warmth, and genuinely dark themes about mortality and desperation.

## Location Atmosphere

### The Floating City Aesthetic
- **Visual Poetry**: The Japanese emphasizes beauty through gentle descriptions - "イカダの上に家がたちならび" (houses lined up on rafts), "美しい町" (beautiful town)
- **Water Symbolism**: Constant references to water as both life-giving and purifying. One NPC philosophically notes water's nature: "たえまなく動いて自分をきれいにしようとする" (ceaselessly moving, trying to purify itself)
- **Duality Theme**: Multiple characters note that beautiful things have hidden sides - "美しいものには必ず裏の顔があるのかしら" (I wonder if beautiful things always have another face)

### Tonal Layers
1. **Surface Level**: Friendly, accommodating townspeople, beautiful scenery
2. **Middle Layer**: Subtle warnings, gossip about "playing with people's lives" (人の命をもてあそぶ)
3. **Dark Underbelly**: The Russian Glass gambling that literally stakes human lives

3. Warning: "命をかけた人生最大のかけごと" (ultimate gambling where you bet your very life)

- Pleading: "死に急ぐなっ！！" (You don't need to be in a hurry to die..!!)
- Greek chorus function - vocalizing the horror the player should feel

**Tim's Perspective Shift:**
- Psychic awareness: "グラスの中の飲み物が血に染まって見える" (The drink in the glass looks as though it's dyed with blood)
- Questioning his power: "これもぼくの体にやどっている力なのか…？" (Is this because of the power dwelling inside my body too...?)
- Simple action: "目をつぶってグラスを一気にのみほした" (closed my eyes and drained the glass) - dissociation from horror

### The Widow and the Will - Emotional Resolution

**The Widow's Voice:**
- Polite, formal: "〜ですから", "〜くださいな"

## Conclusion

Watermia's tone is sophisticated and multifaceted. It presents genuine darkness (the Russian Glass sequence is among the darkest content in the game) while maintaining space for tender romance and character growth. The translation must not shy away from the death gambling horror, the dying man's tragic dignity, or the emotional vulnerability of young love.

The key is maintaining tonal whiplash as intentional - this beautiful place has genuine darkness, these funny moments exist alongside tragedy, this coming-of-age romance happens in a world with real stakes. The Japanese text doesn't smooth these contradictions; it presents them starkly, trusting the player to hold multiple emotional truths simultaneously.

Tim's narration maintains composure throughout, but other characters show full emotional range. Preserve their vulnerability, their awkwardness, their fear, their joy - without editorial distance or modern irony that would undercut genuine feeling.
