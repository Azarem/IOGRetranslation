# Allman (オールマン) - Tim's Father - Comprehensive Tone and Voice Analysis

## Executive Summary

Allman, Tim's father, appears across only 5 chapters (5, 31, 32, 35, 36) with approximately 60 dialogue entries, yet his presence shapes the entire narrative arc. Unlike other parent figures who guide through living presence, Allman guides from death—his decaying corpse lies in Babel Tower while his consciousness persists, teaching Tim cosmic truths while mourning the child he couldn't raise. This document analyzes the Japanese source text to understand how Allman simultaneously embodies the scholar who died seeking truth and the father who loves beyond death.

## Critical Questions Answered

### 1. Does all this text belong to Allman?

**YES** - All entries are correctly attributed despite unconventional presentation. Evidence:

**Chapter 5 (Edward Castle Prison):**
- Japanese marker: **"笛："** (Flute:) 
- Explicit telepathic communication: "うつろな耳に笛からなつかしい声がひびく…" (Through the hollow silence, a familiar voice echoed from the flute...)
- Self-identification: "笛：わたしはおまえの父だ、テム。" (Flute: Tim, I am your father.)
- Voice comes THROUGH the flute, not from a physical presence

**Chapter 31 (Pyramid/Dao):**
- Written journal entry found by Laura
- Japanese marker: **"widestring_039E1A"** in chunk_038000.asm
- First-person narration about hieroglyphic research
- Written BEFORE his death but discovered AFTER
- Content: "私は古代文字ヒエログリフの解読についに成功した" (I have finally succeeded in decoding the ancient hieroglyphic script)

**Chapter 32 (Pyramid):**
- Japanese marker: **"笛："** (Flute:)
- Telepathic message through pyramid's crystal
- Tim's response confirms identity: "テム：とうさん？！" (Tim: Father?!)
- Summoning Tim to Babel Tower

**Chapter 35 (Babel Tower):**
- Japanese marker: **"テムの父："** (Tim's father:)
- Physical corpse present: "古ぼけたしかばねが一つ静かに横たわっている…" (An aged corpse lies quietly...)
- Telepathic voice: "そのとき頭の中に聞く覚えのある声が語りかけてきた。" (At that moment, a familiar voice spoke in my head.)
- Self-identification: "テム。私だよ。お前の父オールマンだ。" (Tim. It's me. Your father Allman.)

**Chapter 36 (Epilogue):**
- Japanese marker: **"テムの父："** (Tim's father:)
- Final cosmic wisdom and farewell

**Consistency markers across all appearances:**
- Uses **"お前"** (omae) to address Tim—an intimate pronoun only a father/superior uses
- References shared past: imprisoned in Edward Castle's same cell, gave Tim the flute
- Consistent first-person: **"私"** (watashi - formal adult masculine)
- Knows personal details only father would: Laura's pies, Tim as a small child, Bill's knowledge

**Potential confusion points:**
- Chapter 5 marked as "Flute:" not "Father:" - but text explicitly establishes telepathic communication
- Chapter 31 is written journal, not direct speech - but clearly his research
- No contradictions or misattributions found

### 2. What implications emerge from location/timeline analysis?

Allman's appearances mark critical narrative turning points and reveal progressive cosmic truth:

**Chapter 5 - Edward Castle (First Contact After 1 Year Separation)**

**Context:** Tim imprisoned after King Edward's betrayal  
**Allman's State:** Already dead/transformed, but cannot reveal this yet  
**Communication Method:** Telepathic voice through the flute  
**Narrative Function:** Initiates Tim's cosmic quest  

**Key Implications:**
- Allman has been "dead" for the full year Tim thought he was missing
- He can only contact Tim in moments of extreme need (prison = crisis)
- He knows about comet approaching: "すい星が近くなればなるほどまものの力は強くなる…" (As the comet draws near, the demons will grow stronger...)
- He was imprisoned in this SAME cell before - shared trauma with son
- Must guide Tim into danger while expressing nostalgic love

**Timing significance:** Exactly 1 year anniversary of Babel expedition = comet's return cycle beginning

---

**Chapter 31 - Pyramid/Dao (Posthumous Discovery)**

**Context:** Laura finds Allman's journal in his belongings, sends it to Tim  
**Allman's State:** Written while alive, discovered after death  
**Communication Method:** Written research notes  
**Narrative Function:** Provides hieroglyphic key for pyramid puzzles  

**Key Implications:**
- Reveals what Allman was researching before death
- His work on hieroglyphics was deliberate, seeking specific knowledge
- He discovered connection between pyramid and "とてつもないなぞ" (tremendous mystery)
- Journal entry is incomplete: "そして…" (And then...) - cuts off at moment of discovery
- He found something in the pyramid that led him to Babel Tower

**Timing significance:** Tim discovers father's research at exact moment he needs it - as if Allman planned this

---

**Chapter 32 - Pyramid (Urgent Summons)**

**Context:** Tim completes pyramid, finds all 5 Mystery Dolls  
**Allman's State:** Telepathic consciousness, increasingly urgent  
**Communication Method:** Voice through pyramid's crystal  
**Narrative Function:** Summons Tim to Babel Tower for final confrontation  

**Key Implications:**
- Escalating cosmic crisis: "すい星が近づいている…" (The comet is approaching...)
- Desperation in voice: "はやくはや.く…" (Quickly, quick..ly...) - ellipsis shows strain
- Reveals Mystery Dolls' purpose: "人類存亡のカギをにぎっている" (hold the key to humanity's survival)
- Allman is IN Babel Tower: "私は今バベルの塔にいる" (I am now in the Tower of Babel)
- Cannot leave or come to Tim - Tim must come to him

**Timing significance:** Moment Tim has all necessary tools (5 dolls, power, knowledge) = moment summons happens

---

**Chapter 35 - Babel Tower (Revelation and Reunion)**

**Context:** Tim enters Babel Tower's inner sanctum  
**Allman's State:** Physical corpse with persisting consciousness  
**Communication Method:** Direct telepathy, face-to-face with corpse  
**Narrative Function:** Explains ALL cosmic mysteries, gives final doll, blesses Tim's mission  

**Key Implications:**
- THIS is where Allman died: Tower's accelerated time killed his body
- He's been trapped here for year, conscious but unable to leave
- Death in Tower = "肉体はくち果てたが私はこうして生き続けている" (My body has totally rotted away, but I still live on like this)
- Gained cosmic knowledge from Tower's properties: "バベルの塔は不思議な空間。内部はすい星の光で満ちている。" (The Tower of Babel is a mysterious space. The interior is full of the comet's light.)
- Learned truth: "時が数百倍の速さで流れ中にいる者はすさまじい速度で進化してゆく…" (Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anybody inside evolves at a terrific rate...)
- Tim and Karen survive because they're "進化した人間" (evolved humans) - created as Warriors

**Timing significance:** Final reunion happens at moment of comet's "大接近" (great approach) - last possible moment

---

**Chapter 36 - Epilogue (Transcendent Wisdom)**

**Context:** After comet's defeat, floating in cosmic space  
**Allman's State:** Fully transcendent consciousness, gained ultimate perspective  
**Communication Method:** Telepathy in cosmic void  
**Narrative Function:** Explains separation, Earth's transformation, grants permission to return  

**Key Implications:**
- Death gave him complete knowledge: "肉体を失ったときすべてが見えるようになったのだ。過去のことも未来のこともそして人類のたどる道もね。" (When I lost my body, I could see everything. The past, the future, and the path humanity will take.)
- Becomes god-like: "人はこういう体を神と呼ぶのかもしれない。" (People might call a body like this a god.)
- Knows Tim and Karen will be separated by timeline changes
- Can offer comfort but not prevent: accepts cosmic necessity
- Final role: grants permission for son to live normal life

**Timing significance:** Only after mission complete can he reveal full truth and let Tim go

---

**Pattern Across Timeline:**

1. **Distance → Proximity**: Telepathic flute voice → written research → crystal message → corpse face-to-face → cosmic presence
2. **Mystery → Revelation**: Vague mission → research clues → urgent summons → complete explanation → transcendent wisdom  
3. **Urgent → Patient**: Must rush Tim in Ch5 → desperate in Ch32 → patient teacher in Ch35 → accepting sage in Ch36
4. **Personal → Cosmic**: Father remembering small child → scholar's notes → summoner → cosmic expositor → universal wisdom
5. **Cannot act → Can bless**: Trapped, can only guide → can only record → can only call → can explain → can release

**The tragedy:** Allman discovered truth but died before sharing it. 
**The redemption:** Consciousness persisted to complete the teaching.

### 3. How does his tone evolve over time?

Allman's voice follows a deliberate progression from nostalgic father to cosmic sage, but NEVER loses his core dual nature: educator + father.

**Phase 1: Wistful Father / Urgent Prophet (Chapter 5)**

**Emotional Register:** Nostalgic longing mixed with desperate urgency  
**Voice Mode:** Personal memories + cosmic mission  
**Sentence Patterns:** Simple declaratives (だ/だよ) + gentle imperatives (なさい)

**Nostalgia and Love:**
```
笛：大きくなったなあかわいいぼうずだったのに。
Flute: You've grown so much. You were such a small boy...

ローラおばあちゃんのパイはおいしいかい？
Are Grandma Laura's pies as good as ever?
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"なあ"** (naa) - wistful, nostalgic particle showing emotion
- **"かわいいぼうず"** (cute little boy) - affectionate diminutive
- **"おいしいかい？"** (delicious + casual question) - intimate, caring

**Urgent Mission-Giving:**
```
テム…時間がない…急ぐのだ…まずはインカの遺跡へ…
Tim... there is no time... make haste... first, to the Incan ruins...

そのちからはきっとおまえに味方するだろう…
That power will become your ally...
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"時間がない"** (no time) - urgent declaration
- **"急ぐのだ"** (make haste) - emphatic imperative with のだ
- **Ellipsis "…"** after nearly EVERY phrase - shows:
  - Emotional weight of sending son to danger
  - Telepathic communication fading in/out
  - Things left unsaid (his own death, true danger)

**Gentle Commands:**
```
敵が残した石を拾いなさい。
Gather the stones left by your enemies.

世界中の遺跡をめぐりミステリードールとよばれる人形をさがしなさい。
Journey to the ruins scattered across the world and seek the figures called Mystery Dolls.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"なさい"** (nasai) - polite imperative, parental tone
- Not harsh "しろ" (shiro - do it!) or casual "して" (shite - please do)
- The imperative a father uses: firm but loving
- Shows he has authority over Tim but exercises it gently

**Phase 1 Summary:** Allman is torn between wanting to comfort his son and needing to thrust him into cosmic danger. The ellipses show this tension - every statement trails off under emotional weight. He speaks with a father's warmth but a prophet's urgency.

---

**Phase 2: Scholarly Researcher (Chapter 31 - Written Journal)**

**Emotional Register:** Intellectual excitement + academic pride  
**Voice Mode:** First-person research narration  
**Sentence Patterns:** Formal academic Japanese

**Academic Declaration:**
```
私は古代文字ヒエログリフの解読についに成功した。これはおそらく世界で初めてのことであろう。
I have finally succeeded in decoding the ancient hieroglyphic script. This is probably the first time in the world this has been accomplished.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"ついに成功した"** (finally succeeded) - triumphant completion
- **"おそらく世界で初めて"** (probably the first in the world) - scholarly pride, but hedged with "おそらく" (probably)
- **"であろう"** (should be) - formal/literary future tense

**Scientific Precision:**
```
このもくしろくによればピラミッドには人類の歴史のとてつもないなぞをとくカギがかくされていることになるのだ。
According to this scripture, the pyramid holds the key to unlocking a tremendous mystery in human history.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"によれば"** (according to) - academic citation
- **"とてつもないなぞ"** (tremendous mystery) - suggests scale but remains vague
- **"ことになるのだ"** (it means that) - explanatory conclusion

**The Incomplete Discovery:**
```
私はピラミッドへ足を運びこれと同じ文字板を発見した。そして…
I visited the pyramid and discovered a tablet with the same script. And then...
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"そして…"** (and then...) - THE CRITICAL CUTOFF
- Written before Babel Tower expedition
- Never finished because he found what he was looking for
- Led directly to his death

**Phase 2 Summary:** This is Allman BEFORE death - passionate researcher, proud of his breakthrough, documenting his process. The incomplete sentence "そして…" is haunting - we know what happened next, but he didn't when he wrote this. Shows the scholar whose curiosity drove him to his doom.

---

**Phase 3: Desperate Summoner (Chapter 32)**

**Emotional Register:** Escalating urgency + strained communication  
**Voice Mode:** Compressed telepathic messages  
**Sentence Patterns:** Short, urgent declarations

**Praising Son's Progress:**
```
笛：これまでよくがんばったね。テム。
Flute: You've done well so far, Tim.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"よくがんばった"** (did well/worked hard) - parental praise
- **"ね"** (ne) - gentle particle, adds warmth despite urgency
- Brief moment of fatherly pride before delivering urgent message

**Desperate Urgency:**
```
すい星が近づいている…テム..はやくはや.く…
The comet is approaching... Tim... quickly, quick..ly...
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"近づいている"** (is approaching) - present progressive, immediate threat
- **"はやくはや.く"** - deliberate break in word "quickly" with ellipsis and period
- Suggests telepathic strain, consciousness fading, extreme urgency
- Grammar itself breaking down under pressure

**Cosmic Stakes:**
```
お前がこれまで集めてきた人形は人類存亡のカギをにぎっている。
The dolls you've collected so far hold the key to humanity's survival.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"人類存亡"** (humanity's survival or extinction) - ultimate stakes
- **"カギをにぎっている"** (holding the key) - metaphorical but concrete
- No longer just "help me" - entire species depends on this

**Phase 3 Summary:** The strain shows. Communication is breaking down, time running out, comet approaching. Allman uses broken grammar and fragmented speech to convey desperate urgency. Yet still calls Tim by name with affection, still praises his efforts. Even in crisis, remains father.

---

**Phase 4: Cosmic Expositor + Tender Father (Chapter 35 - Babel Tower)**

This is Allman's longest appearance and most complex tonal performance. He shifts between THREE registers within the same scene:

**Register A: Tender Reunion**

```
テム。私だよ。お前の父オールマンだ。
Tim. It's me. Your father Allman.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"私だよ"** (it's me) - simple, direct, warm
- **"お前の父"** (your father) - claims relationship explicitly
- No dramatics despite appearing as rotted corpse
- Gentle tone despite horror of visual

**Tim's Anguished Response:**
```
テム：ととうさんっ！どうしてそんな姿にっ！！！
Tim: D-dad...! Why are you in a form like that...!?
```

**Father's Calm Acceptance:**
```
肉体はくち果てたが私はこうして生き続けている..
My body has totally rotted away, but I still live on like this...
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"くち果てた"** (totally rotted away) - graphic but clinical description
- **"が"** (but) - contrast marker, emphasizing paradox
- **"こうして生き続けている"** (still live on like this) - accepting tone
- Two periods ".." create pause, letting truth sink in
- No apology, no horror - just statement of fact

**Register B: Scientific Educator**

Allman delivers LONG expository passages explaining cosmic truth. These use formal academic Japanese with logical structure:

```
はるかむかしすい星から放たれる光を使ったバイオ技術があって、
人々はその力を使い自由に動植物を作りだしていた。
例えばラクダが長期間飲まず食わずで生きていられるのはさばくを移動する乗り物として作られたからだ。
やがて人はこの力を兵器として利用できることに気づき、まものが次々と生みだされた。
まもなく世界ははめつのききにおちいった…

In the distant past, having possession of biotechnology which used the light emitted from the comet,
people used its power to create plants and animals as they desired.
For example, the camel can survive for a long time without food or water because they were made as animals for riding through the desert.
Soon, humans realized that this power could be used to create weapons, and so they gradually produced demons.
Suddenly, the world was at the risk of being destroyed...
```

**Linguistic structure:**
- **Logical connectors:** "はるかむかし" (distant past) → "例えば" (for example) → "やがて" (soon) → "まもなく" (suddenly)
- **Technical vocabulary:** "バイオ技術" (biotechnology), "動植物" (flora and fauna), "兵器" (weapons)
- **Cause-effect reasoning:** X があって (there was X) → Y を使い (using Y) → Z が生まれた (Z was born)
- **Concrete examples:** Uses camel to explain abstract biotech concept - pedagogical technique
- **Building narrative:** Progress → corruption → crisis

**Explanatory emphasis with のだ:**
```
それはお前たちも進化した人間だからだ。
That is because you two are evolved humans as well.

それがお前たちの先祖なのだ。
That is your ancestor.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"からだ"** (because it is) - explanatory emphasis
- **"のだ"** (it is that) - definitive declaration
- Used when stating CRITICAL revelations
- Shows this is THE answer to mysteries

**Register C: Mystical Prophet**

```
そのとき人類の存亡をかけて作り出された光とヤミの戦士。それがお前たちの先祖なのだ。
At that time, the Warrior of Light and Darkness was produced by the fate of mankind; the possible extermination or survival of humanity. That is your ancestor.

さあ最後の一つ命のミステリードールをお前にたくそう。
Well, I'll entrust in you the fated final Mystery Doll.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"人類の存亡をかけて"** (staking humanity's survival) - ultimate cosmic stakes
- **"光とヤミの戦士"** (Warrior of Light and Darkness) - mystical terminology
- **"たくそう"** (I'll entrust) - sacred responsibility, not burden
- **"命のミステリードール"** (Mystery Doll of Life/Destiny) - 命 can mean both

**Gentle Imperative - Still Father:**
```
もうじきすい星が大接近する。お前たちはそれまでに塔の屋上へゆかねばならない。さあ静かに目を閉じなさい…
The comet will be very near soon. I must send you both to the tower's rooftop until then. Well, please quietly close your eyes...
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"ゆかねばならない"** (must go) - formal necessity
- **"さあ"** (well/now) - gentle transition
- **"静かに目を閉じなさい"** (quietly close your eyes) - EXACTLY the imperative a parent uses to help child sleep
- **Ellipsis** - gentle trailing off, soothing

**Phase 4 Summary:** Allman's tour de force. In ONE scene, he is:
1. Tender father reuniting with son ("It's me")
2. Patient educator explaining biotechnology ("For example, the camel...")
3. Mystical prophet revealing destiny ("Warrior of Light and Darkness")
4. Loving parent comforting child ("Close your eyes...")

The Japanese allows these registers to COEXIST without contradiction. He speaks of cosmic horror in a father's gentle voice. This is his essence.

---

**Phase 5: Transcendent Sage (Chapter 36 - Epilogue)**

**Emotional Register:** Calm wisdom + wistful acceptance  
**Voice Mode:** One who has seen everything  
**Sentence Patterns:** Reflective past tense + gentle prophecy

**Revelation of Transcendence:**
```
テムの父：私は肉体を失ったときすべてが見えるようになったのだ。
過去のことも未来のこともそして人類のたどる道もね。
人はこういう体を神と呼ぶのかもしれない。

Tim's Father: When I lost my body, I could see everything.
The past, the future, and the path humanity will take.
People might call a body like this a god.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"すべてが見える"** (can see everything) - complete omniscience
- **"のだ"** (it is that) - explanatory revelation
- **"かもしれない"** (might be) - humble despite god-like state
- **"ね"** (ne) - adds warmth to cosmic statement
- Lists three things he sees: past, future, human path - complete knowledge

**Acceptance of Separation:**
```
そうだ…地球も変わるし人も歴史もすべてが新しい道を歩み始める。
お前たちはたとえどこかの街角で出会ってもおたがい気づかないだろう…
だが地球が光とヤミの戦士を必要としたときお前たちは再びめぐりあうかもしれんな。

Yes... the Earth will change, and people, history—everything will start walking a new path.
Even if you two meet at some street corner, you probably won't notice each other...
But when Earth needs the Warriors of Light and Darkness, you two might meet again.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"そうだ…"** (yes...) - contemplative affirmation with ellipsis
- **"だろう…"** (probably...) - gentle prophecy, not certain
- **"かもしれんな"** (might, you know) - "ん" contraction shows casual wisdom, "な" adds gentle emphasis
- Acknowledges painful truth (separation) but offers hope (might reunite)

**Final Permission:**
```
さあすい星の力が消えないうちに地球へ向かいなさい。
Well, head toward Earth before the comet's power disappears.
```

**Linguistic markers:**
- **"さあ"** (well/now) - gentle transition, same as when he said "close your eyes"
- **"向かいなさい"** (head toward) - parental imperative, gives permission to leave
- This is father saying "go live your life"

**Phase 5 Summary:** Death gave Allman complete perspective. He can see past, future, human destiny. He's become something beyond human—yet still addresses son with "お前" and uses gentle "ね" particle. Still gives fatherly commands with "なさい." Gained cosmic wisdom but never stopped being Tim's father.

---

## Overall Tonal Evolution Pattern

**Consistency:** THREE elements NEVER change:
1. **First-person "私"** (watashi) - formal adult
2. **Second-person "お前"** (omae) to Tim - intimate fatherly
3. **Dual nature:** Educator + Father present in EVERY appearance

**Progression:**
1. **Chapter 5:** Nostalgia (30%) + Mission (70%) = Urgent Father
2. **Chapter 31:** Academic (100%) = Pure Scholar (written before death)
3. **Chapter 32:** Urgency (90%) + Praise (10%) = Desperate Summoner
4. **Chapter 35:** Education (40%) + Fatherhood (40%) + Prophecy (20%) = Complete Character
5. **Chapter 36:** Wisdom (70%) + Acceptance (30%) = Transcendent Sage

**The arc:** Personal urgency → scholarly discovery → desperate crisis → patient revelation → transcendent wisdom

**The constant:** Love for his son expressed through teaching him truth

---

## Core Linguistic Patterns

### First-Person Pronoun Usage

Allman **exclusively** uses **"私"** (watashi) - the formal/neutral first-person pronoun.

**What this reveals:**
- Educated, scholarly background (architect father Bill passed this to him)
- Adult masculine register (not rough "おれ"/ore, not overly humble "ぼく"/boku)
- Maintains dignity even in death
- Same pronoun used for both intimate father moments and cosmic exposition
- Creates unified voice across register shifts

**Never shifts to:**
- "おれ" (ore) - rough masculine, would be inappropriate for educator
- "ぼく" (boku) - young/humble, would undercut authority
- "わし" (washi) - old man, he died relatively young

**Significance:** The unwavering "私" shows Allman's consistent sense of self. Death didn't change WHO he is, only WHAT he knows.

### Second-Person Pronoun Usage - The Heart of Father-Son Relationship

To Tim: **"お前"** (omae) - exclusively, every time

**What this reveals:**
- Superior-to-inferior relationship (father → son)
- Deep intimacy (only used with very close family/subordinates)
- NOT rude in this context - fatherly, affectionate
- Shows unchanged relationship despite death
- Maintains parental authority while expressing love

**Cultural context:**
- Japanese fathers traditionally use "お前" to sons
- Shows Tim is not his equal (even as cosmic warrior)
- But also shows Tim belongs to him (my son, not stranger)
- Western equivalent: difference between "you" and "my boy"

**Example of emotional weight:**
```
お前の父オールマンだ (I am your father, Allman)
お前たちも進化した人間だからだ (because you two are evolved humans)
お前にたくそう (I'll entrust to you)
```

**Never uses:**
- "そなた" (sonata - archaic "thou") - reserved for Gaia speaking to Tim
- "君" (kimi - respectful "you") - too formal/distant for father
- "あなた" (anata - polite "you") - too polite, not intimate enough
- Name "テム" when commanding - uses pronoun to show relationship

**Significance:** Every time Allman says "お前," he reasserts: "I am your father, you are my son, death has not severed this bond."

### Sentence-Final Particles and Emotional Nuance

**"だよ" (da yo) - Gentle Assertion (Chapter 5):**
```
私だよ。お前の父だ、テム。
It's me. I'm your father, Tim.
```
- Warm, familiar particle
- Softens bald statement "私だ" (it's me)
- Shows comfort, reassurance
- "Don't worry, it's just me"

**"だ" (da) - Simple Declarative (All Chapters):**
```
それはお前たちも進化した人間だからだ。
That is because you two are evolved humans.
```
- Plain, direct statement
- Maintains masculine register
- Used for factual information
- No warmth added, but no coldness either

**"のだ" (no da) - Explanatory Emphasis (Chapters 5, 35):**
```
おじいちゃんはね、その石の秘密を知っているのだ。
Your grandfather knows the secret of these stones.

それがお前たちの先祖なのだ。
That is your ancestor.
```
- Provides reason/explanation
- Emphasizes THIS IS THE ANSWER
- Pedagogical particle - teacher explaining
- Shows Allman's educator side

**"からだ" (kara da) - Because-Statement (Chapter 35):**
```
それはお前たちも進化した人間だからだ。
That is because you two are evolved humans.
```
- Explicit causal reasoning
- Scientific explanation style
- Answers "why?" questions
- Scholar providing logic

**"なさい" (nasai) - Parental Imperative (Chapters 5, 35, 36):**
```
石を拾いなさい。(Pick up the stones.)
世界中の遺跡をめぐり人形をさがしなさい。(Journey and seek the dolls.)
さあ静かに目を閉じなさい。(Now quietly close your eyes.)
目をこらしてまわりを見てみなさい。(Focus your eyes and look around.)
地球へ向かいなさい。(Head toward Earth.)
```
- Polite imperative form
- Not harsh "しろ" (shiro - do it!) command
- Not casual "して" (shite - please do) request
- EXACTLY the imperative parents use to children
- Firm but loving, authority with care
- Shows he has right to command but exercises it gently

**"ね" (ne) - Seeking Agreement/Warmth (Chapters 5, 36):**
```
おじいちゃんはね、その石の秘密を知っているのだ。
Your grandfather, you see, knows the secret.

過去のことも未来のこともそして人類のたどる道もね。
The past, the future, and the path humanity will take, you see.
```
- Creates intimacy, connection
- "You understand, right?"
- Softens even cosmic declarations
- Shows Allman wants Tim to UNDERSTAND, not just obey

**"な" (na) - Masculine Gentle Emphasis (Chapter 36):**
```
お前たちは再びめぐりあうかもしれんな。
You two might meet again, you know.
```
- Casual masculine particle
- Gentle, reflective
- "ん" (contraction of ない) + "な" = wisdom spoken gently
- Shows acceptance, not command

**Ellipsis "…" - The Weight of Truth:**

Appears in approximately **60-70%** of Allman's lines. Critical to preserve.

**Functions:**
1. **Emotional Weight (Chapter 5):**
   ```
   そのちからはきっとおまえに味方するだろう…
   That power will become your ally...
   ```
   - Trailing off under weight of what he's not saying (he's dead, danger is immense)

2. **Telepathic Strain (Chapter 32):**
   ```
   すい星が近づいている…テム..はやくはや.く…
   The comet is approaching... Tim... quickly, quick..ly...
   ```
   - Shows consciousness fading, communication breaking down

3. **Cosmic Truth Too Vast for Words (Chapter 35):**
   ```
   時が数百倍の速さで流れ中にいる者はすさまじい速度で進化してゆく…
   Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anybody inside evolves at a terrific rate...
   
   まもなく世界ははめつのききにおちいった…
   Suddenly, the world was at the risk of being destroyed...
   ```
   - Truth is too horrifying for clean sentence endings
   - Implications extend beyond words

4. **Nostalgia and Longing (Chapter 5):**
   ```
   大きくなったなあかわいいぼうずだったのに。
   You've grown so much. You were such a small boy...
   ```
   - Time passed, child grew, father wasn't there to see it
   - Regret compressed into ellipsis

**Translation Note:** Do NOT "clean up" ellipses into periods. They're essential to Allman's voice - showing the gap between what can be said and what is felt/known.

---

## Thematic Threads in Allman's Voice

### Theme 1: The Scholar Who Died for Truth

**Pattern:** Research → Discovery → Death → Transcendence

**Chapter 31 Journal:**
```
私は古代文字ヒエログリフの解読についに成功した。これはおそらく世界で初めてのことであろう。
I have finally succeeded in decoding the ancient hieroglyphic script. This is probably the first time in the world this has been accomplished.
```
- Pride: "ついに成功した" (finally succeeded)
- Ambition: "世界で初めて" (first in the world)
- Scholarly hedging: "おそらく" (probably) - can't be certain without peer review

**The Fatal Curiosity:**
```
このもくしろくによればピラミッドには人類の歴史のとてつもないなぞをとくカギがかくされていることになるのだ。
According to this scripture, the pyramid holds the key to unlocking a tremendous mystery in human history.

私はピラミッドへ足を運びこれと同じ文字板を発見した。そして…
I visited the pyramid and discovered a tablet with the same script. And then...
```
- Investigative drive: "足を運び" (I went to the pyramid) - he HAD to see
- Incomplete sentence: "そして…" (And then...) - never finished
- What happened: He found what led him to Babel Tower
- What happened next: Tower's accelerated time killed him

**Chapter 35 Revelation:**
```
バベルの塔は不思議な空間。内部はすい星の光で満ちている。
時が数百倍の速さで流れ中にいる者はすさまじい速度で進化してゆく…

The Tower of Babel is a mysterious space. The interior is full of the comet's light.
Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anybody inside evolves at a terrific rate...
```
- This is what he discovered
- This is what killed him
- His body "くち果てた" (totally rotted away) because he experienced years in hours
- But his consciousness evolved too, gaining cosmic knowledge

**The Irony:**
- Sought truth about human history
- Found it, but died in the finding
- Death gave him even MORE truth (all past, all future)
- Now knows everything but has no body to use the knowledge

**Linguistic Marker - The Tense Shift:**
- Journal (past tense): "成功した" "発見した" (succeeded, discovered) - actions completed
- Present explanation (present tense): "バベルの塔は不思議な空間" (Tower IS mysterious space) - ongoing reality
- Future prophecy: "お前たちは再びめぐりあうかもしれん" (might meet again) - possibility
- Shows Allman now exists across all time simultaneously

**Translation Principle:** Allman is NOT stupid for entering the Tower. He's a brilliant researcher following truth logically. His tragedy is that curiosity (humanity's greatest strength) led to his death. Maintain his intelligence and scholarly passion, or his sacrifice loses meaning.

---

### Theme 2: The Father Who Loves Beyond Death

**The Impossibility:** How do you be a father when you're dead?

**Allman's Answer:** Teach what you learned, protect from what you can, accept what you cannot change.

**Chapter 5 - Teaching Through Mission:**
```
笛：大きくなったなあかわいいぼうずだったのに。
ローラおばあちゃんのパイはおいしいかい？
```
- Remembers Tim as small child - "かわいいぼうず" (cute little boy)
- Asks about Laura's pies - domestic, normal, fatherly concern
- Creates connection through shared memory
- Shows he's kept Tim in his thoughts for the year he's been "gone"

**Then immediately:**
```
おまえに一つたのみがある。聞いてくれるか？
I have something to ask of you. Will you hear me?
```
- Shifts to formal request: "たのみ" (favor/request)
- Polite question: "聞いてくれるか？" (will you listen?)
- Despite authority as father, ASKS permission
- Shows respect for Tim's agency

**The Torn Father:**
```
おまえはこれから少しだけこわい目にあうことになるよ。
You will face frightening trials ahead.
```
- Warns of danger: "こわい目" (scary things)
- Diminishes with "少しだけ" (just a little) - trying to soften truth
- But particle "よ" shows he's telling truth he wishes he could hide
- Father who must send son to danger - knows it, hates it, does it anyway

**Chapter 35 - The Reunion:**

Tim sees corpse. Then:
```
テム。私だよ。お前の父オールマンだ。
Tim. It's me. Your father Allman.
```
- Says own name - might not recognize voice/appearance
- "私だよ" (it's me) - the same gentle assertion from Chapter 5
- Maintains calm despite knowing Tim is horrified
- Immediately establishes: I'm still your father

**Tim's Breakdown:**
```
テム：ととうさんっ！どうしてそんな姿にっ！！！
Tim: D-dad...! Why are you in a form like that...!?
```
- Stutters: "ととうさん" (D-dad)
- Triple exclamation marks - most emotional moment in game
- Tim's composure completely breaks

**Allman's Response:**
```
肉体はくち果てたが私はこうして生き続けている..
My body has totally rotted away, but I still live on like this...
```
- No apology, no horror, no drama
- Clinical description: "くち果てた" (totally rotted)
- Simple contrast: "が" (but) - body dead, consciousness alive
- Two periods create pause - letting Tim absorb truth
- Doesn't try to comfort with lies - tells truth gently

**Then - Father Mode Returns:**
```
さあ静かに目を閉じなさい…
Well, please quietly close your eyes...
```
- "さあ" (well/now) - gentle transition
- "静かに" (quietly) - soothing adverb
- "なさい" (imperative) - parental form
- EXACTLY what you say to child before sleep
- In death, still soothing his son

**Chapter 36 - The Release:**
```
さあすい星の力が消えないうちに地球へ向かいなさい。
Well, head toward Earth before the comet's power disappears.
```
- Final command: go live
- Uses "なさい" - still father, still has right to command
- But command is "leave me, return to life"
- Lets Tim go - ultimate parental love

**Linguistic Pattern - The Consistent "お前":**

Every chapter, every mode, Allman calls Tim "お前" (omae):
- Chapter 5 nostalgic mode: "お前の父だ" (I'm your father)
- Chapter 5 mission mode: "おまえに一つたのみがある" (I have a request for you)
- Chapter 32 urgent mode: "お前がこれまで集めてきた人形" (the dolls you've collected)
- Chapter 35 expositor mode: "それはお前たちも進化した人間だからだ" (because you two are evolved humans)
- Chapter 35 tender mode: "お前にたくそう" (I'll entrust to you)
- Chapter 36 release mode: "お前たちはたとえどこかの街角で出会っても" (even if you two meet at some street corner)

**Never:**
- Uses Tim's name in commands (that would be distant)
- Uses "そなた" (sonata - archaic "thou") (that would be god speaking, not father)
- Uses "君" (kimi - respectful you) (too formal, would create distance)

**Significance:** The unwavering "お前" says: "You are MY son. I am YOUR father. Death, time, cosmic transformation - none of this changes the fundamental relationship."

**Translation Principle:** Allman's fatherhood must come through even in cosmic horror. When he's explaining biotechnology and evolution, he's still teaching HIS SON. When he's warning about demons, he's still trying to protect HIS BOY. The scholarly exposition and tender father aren't separate modes - they're the same love expressed through teaching.

---

### Theme 3: Time and Transformation

**Allman exists across three temporal states:**

1. **Past (alive):** The researcher in journals, the father who imprisoned in same cell, the man who went to Babel Tower
2. **Present (dead but conscious):** The telepathic guide, the rotted corpse that speaks
3. **Future (transcendent):** The consciousness that sees all time, past and future

**Chapter 5 - Cannot Reveal Present State:**
```
テム：父さん！どこにいるの？！
Tim: Father! Where are you?!

笛：今は言えない…
Flute: I cannot tell you that now...
```
- "今は" (now/at this time) - temporal marker
- "言えない" (cannot say) - not "won't say" but "cannot"
- Ellipsis shows pain of this limitation
- He wants to tell truth but timing is wrong

**Why he can't reveal:**
- Tim not ready for truth (would break him)
- Mission not yet started (Tim needs to begin journey first)
- Cosmic timing (comet not close enough yet)

**Chapter 35 - Present State Revealed:**
```
バベルの塔は不思議な空間。内部はすい星の光で満ちている。
時が数百倍の速さで流れ中にいる者はすさまじい速度で進化してゆく…

The Tower of Babel is a mysterious space. The interior is full of the comet's light.
Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anybody inside evolves at a terrific rate...
```
- Present tense: "時が流れ" (time flows) - ongoing, continuous
- Passive experience: "者はすさまじい速度で進化してゆく" (those inside evolve) - it happens TO you
- This is what happened TO Allman - couldn't escape, body aged/died, consciousness evolved

**The Paradox:**
```
肉体はくち果てたが私はこうして生き続けている..
My body has totally rotted away, but I still live on like this...
```
- Past tense: "くち果てた" (rotted away) - completed action
- Present tense: "生き続けている" (continue living) - ongoing state
- Grammar itself shows dual existence: dead AND alive

**Chapter 36 - Future Vision Gained:**
```
私は肉体を失ったときすべてが見えるようになったのだ。
過去のことも未来のこともそして人類のたどる道もね。

When I lost my body, I could see everything.
The past, the future, and the path humanity will take.
```
- Past tense marker: "失ったとき" (when I lost) - moment of transformation
- Result state: "見えるようになった" (became able to see) - gained new ability
- Scope of vision: past + future + human path = ALL time
- Casual "ね" particle despite cosmic scope - still conversational father

**The Cruel Gift:**
```
人はこういう体を神と呼ぶのかもしれない。
People might call a body like this a god.
```
- "かもしれない" (might) - humble despite power
- "こういう体" (body like this) - but he has NO body, that's the point
- Irony: called god-like, but can't even touch son
- Knowledge without ability to act on it

**Linguistic Pattern - Tense Markers:**

Allman uses **specific tense markers** to show when he's speaking from:

**Past (experience):**
- "わたしもまえにこのろうやにつながれていたことがあるのだ" (I was also imprisoned here before)
- "〜ていた" (was ~ing) - past continuous
- "ことがある" (have experience of) - shows shared history with Tim

**Present (ongoing reality):**
- "私は今バベルの塔にいる" (I am now in Babel Tower)
- "今" (now) - explicit present marker
- Shows trapped state is current, not past

**Future (prophecy/possibility):**
- "お前たちは再びめぐりあうかもしれん" (you might meet again)
- "かもしれん" (might) - future possibility
- Not certain, but informed by his vision of all time

**Translation Principle:** Preserve Allman's tense markers precisely. They show his relationship to time has fundamentally changed. He speaks of past, present, future with equal clarity because he exists across all three.

---

### Theme 4: The Unwanted God / "招かれざる神" (Uninvited God)

**Allman's most profound philosophical statement** (Chapter 35):

```
かつて古代人たちはすい星を神とあがめた。
すい星の光をあびたものには不思議な力がやどったからだ。
確かにすい星は神といえる。すい星は一つの生命体ともいえる。だがそれは招かれざる神なのだ。

Ancient people once worshipped the comet as a god.
A mysterious power dwells in things that are showered in the comet's light, after all.
Certainly, you could call the comet a god. You could also call it a singular lifeform. But it's a god that no one asked for.
```

**Linguistic Breakdown:**

**Setup - Historical Fact:**
- "かつて" (once, in the past) - establishes historical pattern
- "神とあがめた" (worshipped as god) - humans gave it divine status
- "からだ" (because) - explains WHY: power came from it

**Acknowledgment - Logical Progression:**
- "確かに" (certainly, indeed) - conceding the point
- "神といえる" (could call it god) - technically accurate
- "生命体ともいえる" (could also call it lifeform) - adds dimension
- Two "いえる" (could say) statements show he's being analytical

**The Turn - Critical Truth:**
- "だが" (but) - pivotal contrast marker
- "それは招かれざる神なのだ" (it's an uninvited god)
- "招かれざる" (uninvited/unwanted) - negative passive form
- "なのだ" (it is that) - emphatic declaration

**Japanese Cultural Concept:**
The term "招かれざる" (uninvited) carries deep cultural weight:
- "招く" (manekareru) = to invite, to welcome
- Adding "ざる" = classical negative = "not invited"
- In Japanese culture, uninvited presence = violation of order, boundary transgression
- Even powerful beings should be INVITED, not impose themselves

**The Philosophy:**
God can be:
1. **Powerful** - comet has power
2. **Conscious** - comet has will
3. **Influential** - comet affects evolution

But still be:
4. **Unwanted** - humans never asked for this
5. **Harmful** - "速すぎる進歩からははめつだけが生まれる…" (Too-fast progress only creates destruction)
6. **Invasive** - imposes change without consent

**Allman's Parallel:**
This is also Allman's self-reflection. He became god-like:
- "肉体を失ったとき" - lost body
- "すべてが見える" - can see everything
- "人はこういう体を神と呼ぶのかもしれない" - might be called god

But he's ALSO an unwanted god in sense:
- Tim didn't ask for father to die
- Tim didn't ask for father to become consciousness without body
- Tim didn't ask to be warrior created by ancient biotech
- Family wanted normal father/son relationship - got cosmic horror instead

**The Continuation:**
```
速すぎる進歩からははめつだけが生まれる…
人の心に悪があるかぎりあらゆるまものが生み出されてしまう。

Too-fast progress only creates destruction...
As long as there is evil in people's hearts, demons will be born.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- "速すぎる" (too fast) - excess is the problem, not progress itself
- "だけが生まれる" (only ~ is born) - exclusive, limiting result
- "かぎり" (as long as) - conditional: evil exists → demons exist
- "生み出されてしまう" (are produced [unfortunately]) - "しまう" adds regret

**The Warning:**
Comet offers:
- Power (good)
- Evolution (good)
- Knowledge (good)

But at speed humans can't handle:
- Creates weapons instead of tools
- Creates demons instead of helpers
- Creates destruction instead of progress

**Why Allman Can Say This:**
He experienced it personally:
- Tower's accelerated time killed his body
- Accelerated evolution made him god-like
- Too much, too fast = death even as it grants knowledge

**Translation Principle:** "招かれざる神" (uninvited god) is THE key concept. Don't soften to "unwelcome" or "unexpected." The god IMPOSES itself, violates boundary, gives gifts no one asked for. This explains why Tim must fight the comet despite its power - it's not evil, but it's invasive, and invasion must be resisted even when invader is powerful.

---

### Theme 5: Entrustment and Sacred Responsibility (託す - takusu)

**The verb "たくす/託す" (entrust) appears THREE times in Allman's dialogue - always at critical moments:**

**Usage 1 - Chapter 35 (The Final Doll):**
```
さあ最後の一つ命のミステリードールをお前にたくそう。
Well, I'll entrust to you the fated final Mystery Doll.
```

**Usage 2 - Chapter 36 (Gaia speaking, but pattern established by Allman):**
```
私はすべてののぞみをそなたにたくそう…
I will entrust all my hopes to thee...
```

**The Japanese Concept of 託す:**

Not merely "give" or "pass on" - 託す carries specific cultural weight:

**Etymology:**
- 言 (word/promise) + 乇 (request/entrust)
- Originally: entrust words/message to another
- Evolved: entrust anything precious requiring care

**Connotations:**
1. **Sacred trust** - not casual lending
2. **Faith in recipient** - believe they're worthy
3. **Responsibility transfer** - now theirs to bear
4. **Cannot take back** - irrevocable handoff
5. **Honor in accepting** - not burden, but trust

**Compare to other "give" verbs:**

**あげる (ageru)** - give (neutral):
- "本をあげる" (give a book)
- No special weight

**与える (ataeru)** - bestow (superior to inferior):
- "知識を与える" (bestow knowledge)
- Shows power difference

**渡す (watasu)** - hand over (physical transfer):
- "カギを渡す" (hand over key)
- Focus on physical action

**託す (takusu)** - entrust (sacred responsibility):
- "未来を託す" (entrust the future)
- "命を託す" (entrust one's life)
- "子供を託す" (entrust child to someone's care)
- Shows deep faith, serious stakes

**Why Allman Uses 託す:**

**For the Final Mystery Doll:**
```
さあ最後の一つ命のミステリードールをお前にたくそう。
```

- Not just giving object
- Not just passing item
- **Entrusting humanity's survival tool**
- "命のミステリードール" = Mystery Doll of Life/Destiny
- This doll creates Warriors of Light and Darkness
- Tim must guard it, use it correctly, complete the mission
- Allman has faith Tim will succeed

**The Weight of This Moment:**
- Father giving son tool of cosmic importance
- Father who can no longer act, entrusting son who can
- Generational handoff: past → future
- Allman gathered 5 dolls through research/exploration
- Now gives 6th and final one to complete set
- Tim must do what Allman cannot: use them

**Linguistic Structure:**
- "さあ" (well/now) - gentle transition despite gravity
- "最後の一つ" (the final one) - emphasizes completion, last piece
- "命の" (of life/destiny) - highest stakes possible
- "お前に" (to you) - specifically Tim, not random person
- "たくそう" (will entrust) - volitional form, deliberate choice

**Trust Pattern in Allman's Arc:**

**Chapter 5 - Trust Tim to Begin:**
```
敵が残した石を拾いなさい。
Pick up the stones.

世界中の遺跡をめぐりミステリードールとよばれる人形をさがしなさい。
Journey to ruins and seek Mystery Dolls.
```
- Commands with "なさい" - expects obedience
- But commands show trust Tim CAN do this
- Wouldn't give mission to someone he didn't trust

**Chapter 32 - Trust Tim's Progress:**
```
これまでよくがんばったね。テム。
You've done well so far, Tim.
```
- Praise = recognition of effort
- Shows Tim has proven himself worthy
- Foundation for larger entrustment coming

**Chapter 35 - Final Entrustment:**
```
さあ最後の一つ命のミステリードールをお前にたくそう。
Well, I'll entrust to you the fated final Mystery Doll.
```
- Tim has earned this through journey
- Allman's faith justified by Tim's actions
- Sacred transfer of responsibility

**Chapter 36 - Trust Tim to Live:**
```
さあすい星の力が消えないうちに地球へ向かいなさい。
Well, head toward Earth before the comet's power disappears.
```
- Final command: go live your life
- Trusts Tim to find Karen ("何年かかっても" - no matter how many years)
- Trusts Tim to be normal child again
- Releases him - ultimate trust

**The Chain of Entrustment:**

1. **Ancient humans** → created Warriors, entrusted survival to them
2. **Warriors** → entrusted dolls to ruins/hiding
3. **Bill (grandfather)** → entrusted architectural knowledge to Allman
4. **Laura** → entrusted melody to Tim, entrusted Tim to Lillie's rescue
5. **Allman** → entrusts final doll to Tim, entrusts mission to Tim
6. **Tim** → must entrust future to next generation (implied)

**Japanese Cultural Resonance:**
- 家督を託す (entrust family headship)
- 後を託す (entrust one's successor)
- 遺志を託す (entrust one's will/wishes)

Allman is doing ALL THREE:
- Entrusting family legacy (father to son)
- Entrusting successor role (Tim replaces Allman as warrior)
- Entrusting will/wishes (complete what I couldn't)

**Translation Principle:** "Entrust" must be used for "たくす" - not "give," not "pass," not "hand over." The sacred weight must be preserved. This is father entrusting son with humanity's fate. The word choice carries the entire relationship's gravity.

## Comparative Voice Analysis

### Allman vs. Shira (Contrasting Parental Guides)

Both are Tim's deceased parents speaking from beyond, yet fundamentally different:

| Aspect | Allman (Father) | Shira (Mother) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **First-Person** | 私 (watashi - formal) | 私 (watashi - formal) |
| **To Tim** | お前 (omae - intimate superior) | あなた (anata - warm you) [implied from tone documents] |
| **Physical State** | Corpse present in Babel Tower | Never physically present |
| **Death Cause** | Accelerated time in Tower | Unspecified |
| **Communication** | Through flute, crystal, direct telepathy | Dream/vision, telepathic voice |
| **Content Focus** | WHAT Tim is, WHY it happened | HOW to feel, WHAT to choose |
| **Teaching Style** | Logical exposition, scientific explanation | Socratic questions, emotional guidance |
| **Emotional Tone** | Torn between love and mission | Consistently warm, patient |
| **Register Shifts** | Scholar ↔ Father ↔ Prophet | Gentle mother → Cosmic mother (but always warm) |
| **Particle Usage** | だ, のだ, からだ (explanatory emphasis) | の, のよ, ね, わ (warm feminine) |
| **Imperatives** | なさい (parental command) | Rare commands, mostly questions |
| **Ellipsis Function** | Weight of truth, telepathic strain | Contemplative, cosmic time |
| **Final Message** | "Go live" (command to act) | "I hope wonderful future comes" (blessing) |

**Complementary Roles:**
- **Allman** provides intellectual framework: "You are evolved human created as warrior"
- **Shira** provides emotional context: "The comet could be fortune or misfortune - what do you think?"

**Together they give Tim:**
- **Knowledge** (Allman: scientific truth, biotechnology, ancient history)
- **Wisdom** (Shira: perspective, emotional processing, acceptance)
- **Mission** (Allman: collect dolls, defeat comet)
- **Comfort** (Shira: watching over you, will be okay)

**Why Both Needed:**
Japanese parenting traditionally divides:
- Father = public, education, mission, logic
- Mother = private, emotion, comfort, intuition

Game honors this while subverting it:
- Both are dead (neither can "parent" normally)
- Both guide from beyond (equal mystical access)
- Both love Tim equally (shown through different languages)

**Voice Distinction for Translation:**

**Allman speaks in paragraphs** - long explanatory passages:
```
はるかむかしすい星から放たれる光を使ったバイオ技術があって、人々はその力を使い自由に動植物を作りだしていた。例えばラクダが長期間飲まず食わずで生きていられるのはさばくを移動する乗り物として作られたからだ。やがて人はこの力を兵器として利用できることに気づき、まものが次々と生みだされた。
```

**Shira speaks in questions and gentle observations** - conversational flow:
```
すい星はね長い長い年月をかけて地球にやってきてそしてまた遠ざかっていくの。あの星を不幸を呼ぶ星っていう人もいればしあわせの星と呼ぶ人もいるわ…テム。あなたはどっちだと思う？
```

**Don't let them sound the same.** Allman teaches through explanation, Shira through questioning.

### Allman vs. Bill (Grandfather) - Scholar Legacy

**Bill** (Tim's grandfather):
- Was architect
- Built Edward Castle (including prison where Tim and Allman were both held)
- Knew "secret of stones" 
- Passed knowledge to Allman

**From Tim Dialogue File reference:**
```
テム：おじいちゃん？建築家だったんでしょ？..
Tim: Grandpa? He was an architect, wasn't he?

笛：おじいちゃんはね、その石の秘密を知っているのだ。
Flute: Your grandfather, you see, knows the secret of these stones.
```

**Pattern - Three Generations of Knowledge:**
1. Bill (architect) → understood stones' power in construction
2. Allman (researcher) → understood stones' cosmic origin
3. Tim (warrior) → must use stones' power for battle

**Voice Contrast** (based on other documents):
- **Bill**: Practical, builder, earthly knowledge
- **Allman**: Theoretical, researcher, cosmic knowledge
- Both educators, but different domains

**Why This Matters:**
Allman isn't random scholar - he inherited intellectual curiosity from Bill. Tim isn't random warrior - he inherited it from Allman. The entrustment chain is also knowledge chain.

### Allman vs. Gaia - Cosmic Guides Using Different Registers

**Gaia** speaks with:
- **そなた** (sonata - archaic "thou")
- **である** forms (classical)
- **〜であろう** (shall be) - archaic future
- No personal pronouns to self
- Timeless, eternal, beyond human

**Allman** speaks with:
- **お前** (omae - fatherly "you")
- **だ/のだ** forms (modern)
- **〜だろう** (probably) - modern speculation
- **私** (watashi - I)
- Bound by personal history, human even in transcendence

**Both are guides. Both have cosmic knowledge. But:**

**Gaia to Tim:**
```
そなただけ。私はすべてののぞみをそなたにたくそう…
Thou alone. I will entrust all my hopes to thee...
```
- Formal, distant, archaic
- Tim is "chosen one" to eternal force
- Relationship is destiny, not blood

**Allman to Tim:**
```
さあ最後の一つ命のミステリードールをお前にたくそう。
Well, I'll entrust to you the fated final Mystery Doll.
```
- Personal, intimate, modern
- Tim is "my son" to father
- Relationship is blood and love

**Same verb たくす (entrust), completely different emotional registers.**

**Translation Principle:** Don't make Allman sound like Gaia. He's cosmic in knowledge but human in heart. He can explain evolution and biotechnology while asking if Laura's pies taste good. This contradiction IS the character.

---

## Unique Japanese Cultural/Linguistic Elements

### The Concept of 肉体 (nikutai - Physical Body) vs. Consciousness

**Allman's Key Statement:**
```
肉体はくち果てたが私はこうして生き続けている..
My body has totally rotted away, but I still live on like this...
```

**Japanese Buddhist Philosophy:**
- **肉体** (nikutai) = physical flesh body, temporary vessel
- **精神** (seishin) = spirit/consciousness, potential to continue
- **心** (kokoro) = heart/mind/spirit, the essential self

**Western dualism:** Body vs. Soul (binary, separated)
**Japanese conception:** Body (temporary) containing Spirit (potential to persist) containing Heart (essential self)

**Allman exists as:**
- ❌ 肉体 (nikutai) - lost, rotted
- ✓ 精神 (seishin) - persisting as consciousness
- ✓ 心 (kokoro) - still feels love for son, regret, hope

**Why This Allows Him to Function:**
In Western framework: Dead = gone
In Japanese framework: Body dead ≠ person gone

Allman can be:
- Dead (肉体はくち果てた)
- Alive (生き続けている)
- SIMULTANEOUSLY

**Translation Challenge:**
English lacks this nuance. "Body" vs. "spirit" forces binary Western reading.

**Potential Solutions:**
- "My flesh has rotted away" (emphasizes physical meat)
- "My physical form has perished" (emphasizes form vs. essence)
- "My body is gone" (simple, lets context carry meaning)

Avoid: "My corporeal form" (too clinical), "My earthly vessel" (too religious)

### The Particle なさい (nasai) - Japanese Parental Imperative

**Appears in ALL Allman's command statements:**

```
石を拾いなさい。(Pick up the stones.)
世界中の遺跡をめぐり人形をさがしなさい。(Journey and seek the dolls.)
さあ静かに目を閉じなさい。(Now quietly close your eyes.)
目をこらしてまわりを見てみなさい。(Focus your eyes and look around.)
地球へ向かいなさい。(Head toward Earth.)
```

**Imperative Forms in Japanese (from harsh to gentle):**

1. **しろ** (shiro) - HARSH: Do it! (military, angry)
2. **せよ** (seyo) - FORMAL COMMAND: Do this (legal, official)
3. **しなさい** (shinasai) - PARENTAL: You should do (parent to child)
4. **してください** (shite kudasai) - POLITE REQUEST: Please do (to equal/superior)
5. **してくれ** (shite kure) - CASUAL REQUEST: Do this for me (to friend)
6. **してもらえる？** (shite moraeru?) - SOFT REQUEST: Could you do? (very polite)

**Allman ALWAYS uses #3: なさい (nasai)**

**What This Reveals:**
- Parent speaking to child (not equal, not stranger)
- Authority to command (father's right)
- But gentle exercise of authority (not harsh or angry)
- Expects obedience but with care
- Traditional Japanese father-son dynamic

**Western Equivalent Challenge:**
English has ONE imperative form: "Do X"

Can soften with:
- "Please" (but too polite for parent to child)
- "Go ahead and" (but too casual)
- "You should" (but too weak, not command)

**Translation Strategy:**
Vary by context:
- Mission commands: Simple imperative: "Gather the stones."
- Comfort commands: Add softening: "Close your eyes now."
- Release commands: Mix with reason: "Head toward Earth."

Avoid:
- Adding "please" (too formal)
- Adding "you must" (too harsh)
- Adding "I want you to" (too indirect)

The authority + gentleness must both come through.

### The Concept of 招かれざる神 (Manekare-zaru Kami - Uninvited God)

**Full Quote:**
```
確かにすい星は神といえる。すい星は一つの生命体ともいえる。だがそれは招かれざる神なのだ。
Certainly, you could call the comet a god. You could also call it a singular lifeform. But it's a god that no one asked for.
```

**Japanese Concept of 招き (Invitation/Welcome):**

**招く (maneku)** = to invite, to summon, to welcome
- **招待** (shōtai) = invitation (formal)
- **招き猫** (maneki-neko) = beckoning cat (brings good fortune when INVITED)
- **災いを招く** (wazawai wo maneku) = to invite disaster (metaphor - disaster comes when called)

**Adding 「ざる」 = Classical Negative:**
- Modern negative: ない (nai)
- Classical negative: ぬ (nu) / ず (zu) / ざる (zaru)
- 招く (invite) + ざる (not) = 招かれざる (uninvited)

**Cultural Weight:**
In Japanese social structure:
- Boundaries are sacred
- Invitation = permission to cross boundary
- Uninvited presence = violation, even if powerful

**Examples in Culture:**
- Uninvited guest = 押しかけ (oshikake) = pushy intrusion
- Even gods must be invited to shrines (神社)
- Spirits that come uninvited = 禍 (wazawai) = calamity

**Why Comet is Uninvited God:**
1. **Has divine power** - gives abilities, controls evolution
2. **Has consciousness** - thinks, plans, manipulates
3. **But no one asked it to come** - approaches on own schedule
4. **Imposes changes** - humans didn't consent to evolution manipulation
5. **Violates boundaries** - crosses from space into Earth's domain
6. **Gives unwanted gifts** - power that leads to weapons and demons

**The Philosophy:**
Power without permission = violation
Even beneficial power = violation if forced

**Allman's Wisdom:**
He's not saying comet is evil
He's saying comet is INTRUSIVE
It could be god, it could be beneficial
But humanity never invited it, never consented
Therefore must be resisted

**Translation Challenge:**
"Uninvited god" works literally
But loses cultural depth of boundary violation

**Potential alternatives:**
- "Unwelcome god" (softer, less accurate)
- "Unsummoned god" (implies magical context)
- "God that came unbidden" (archaic English matches archaic Japanese)
- "God no one asked for" (conversational, clear)

**Recommend:** "Uninvited god" in text, but translators must UNDERSTAND the cultural concept to convey tone correctly.

### The Verb 拓す (takusu) - Sacred Entrustment

[See full analysis in Theme 5 above]

**Key Point for Translation:**
This verb appears only 3 times in Allman's dialogue but is CRITICALLY important.

**English verbs that DON'T capture it:**
- "give" - too casual
- "pass on" - too neutral
- "hand over" - too transactional
- "bequeath" - too formal/legal
- "grant" - implies superior bestowing on inferior

**Only "entrust" captures:**
- Sacred responsibility transfer
- Faith in recipient
- Irrevocable handoff
- Honor in accepting

**Must translate たくす as "entrust" every time.**

## Translation Guidelines and Challenges

### Challenge 1: Maintaining Three-Register Voice

**The Problem:**
Allman speaks in three distinct modes within same scenes:
1. **Gentle Father:** "ローラおばあちゃんのパイはおいしいかい？" (Are Laura's pies good?)
2. **Scientific Educator:** "バイオ技術があって" (biotechnology existed)
3. **Mystical Prophet:** "光とヤミの戦士" (Warrior of Light and Darkness)

English tendency: force consistency, smooth register shifts.
**Japanese reality:** register shifts are THE CHARACTER.

**Solution:**
Don't smooth. Let the shifts happen.

**Example - Chapter 35 sequence:**

```
テム。私だよ。お前の父オールマンだ。
[Gentle, personal, intimate]
"Tim. It's me. Your father, Allman."

肉体はくち果てたが私はこうして生き続けている..
[Clinical but gentle]
"My body has rotted away, but I still live on like this..."

バベルの塔は不思議な空間。内部はすい星の光で満ちている。
[Scientific, formal]
"The Tower of Babel is a mysterious space. The interior is full of the comet's light."

時が数百倍の速さで流れ中にいる者はすさまじい速度で進化してゆく…
[Technical exposition]
"Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anyone inside evolves at a terrific rate..."

それはお前たちも進化した人間だからだ。
[Explanatory, teaching]
"That is because you two are evolved humans."

はるかむかしすい星から放たれる光を使ったバイオ技術があって、
[Academic lecture begins]
"In the distant past, there was biotechnology using the comet's light..."

そのとき人類の存亡をかけて作り出された光とヤミの戦士。それがお前たちの先祖なのだ。
[Cosmic prophecy]
"At that time, the Warriors of Light and Darkness were created to decide humanity's survival. That is your ancestor."

さあ最後の一つ命のミステリードールをお前にたくそう。
[Gentle father giving gift]
"Well, I'll entrust to you the final Mystery Doll of Life."
```

**All within minutes of conversation.**

**Translation Strategy:**

**Gentle Father Register:**
- Use contractions: "It's me"
- Simple vocabulary: "good," "nice"
- Direct address: "Tim"
- Familiar phrasing

**Scientific Register:**
- No contractions: "The interior is full"
- Technical terms: "biotechnology," "evolution"
- Longer sentences with subordinate clauses
- Logical connectors: "In the distant past," "For example"

**Prophetic Register:**
- Archaic constructions: "were created," "decide humanity's fate"
- Mystical terminology: "Warriors of Light and Darkness"
- Declarative statements: "That is your ancestor"
- Ellipses for weight

**Don't force uniform tone. The shifting IS Allman - he's ALL THREE at once.**

### Challenge 2: The Telepathic Voice Markers

**Chapter 5 Problem:**
Japanese: "笛：" (Flute:)
English speaker tag: "Flute: Are Laura's pies good?"

**This sounds absurd** - flutes don't speak.

**The Japanese Context:**
- Full sentence before: "うつろな耳に笛からなつかしい声がひびく…" (Through hollow silence, a familiar voice echoed from the flute...)
- Establishes VOICE THROUGH FLUTE
- Then dialogue marker "笛：" is shorthand
- Reader understands: voice coming from flute, not flute speaking

**English Translation Options:**

**Option 1 - Maintain Flute marker but add clarification:**
```
[Narrator]: Through the hollow silence, a familiar voice echoed from the flute...
[Voice through Flute]: "Tim..."
[Voice through Flute]: "Tim, I am your father."
```

**Option 2 - Use character name once identified:**
```
[Narrator]: Through the hollow silence, a familiar voice echoed from the flute...
[Flute]: "Tim..."
[Flute]: "Tim, I am your father."
[Allman (through flute)]: "You've grown so much..."
```

**Option 3 - Italics for telepathic communication:**
```
Through the hollow silence, a familiar voice echoed from the flute...
*Tim...*
*Tim, I am your father.*
```

**Option 4 - Special formatting in game engine:**
- Different text box color
- Wavy text
- Special sound effect

**Recommend:** Option 1 or 2 for clarity. Establish "voice through flute" then use shorthand. English readers need more explicit markers than Japanese.

**Chapter 32 Problem:**
Similar issue - voice comes from pyramid's crystal.

**Chapter 35-36 Problem:**
Direct telepathy, but Tim sees corpse.
Need to distinguish: corpse's mouth isn't moving, but voice is in Tim's head.

**General Principle:**
Telepathic speech should be:
1. **Visually distinct** (italics, special formatting, or clear markers)
2. **Established in narration** ("a voice spoke in my head")
3. **Maintained consistently** (don't switch formats mid-scene)

### Challenge 3: Balancing Fatherly Warmth with Cosmic Horror

**The Scene:** Tim sees his father's rotted corpse.

**Japanese:**
```
古ぼけたしかばねが一つ静かに横たわっている…
そのとき頭の中に聞く覚えのある声が語りかけてきた。
テム。私だよ。お前の父オールマンだ。
肉体はくち果てたが私はこうして生き続けている..
```

**Literal Translation:**
```
An aged corpse lies quietly...
At that moment, a familiar voice spoke in my head.
Tim. It's me. Your father, Allman.
My body has rotted away, but I still live on like this...
```

**The Tonal Challenge:**
This should be:
- **Horrifying** (rotted corpse)
- **Tender** (father's voice)
- **Calm** (Allman's acceptance)
- **Anguished** (Tim's response)

**All at once.**

**Common Translation Mistake:**
Add dramatic language to match horror:
- ❌ "A GRUESOME corpse lay there..."
- ❌ "I was SHOCKED to hear..."
- ❌ "My flesh has DECAYED..."

**Why This Fails:**
Allman is calm. He's had year to accept. The horror is Tim's, not Allman's.

**Correct Approach:**
Let the facts be horrifying:
- ✓ "An aged corpse lies quietly..." (clinical description)
- ✓ "It's me." (gentle simplicity)
- ✓ "My body has rotted away" (direct, unadorned truth)

**Then Tim provides the emotion:**
```
テム：ととうさんっ！どうしてそんな姿にっ！！！
Tim: D-dad...! Why are you in a form like that...!?
```
- Stuttering
- Triple exclamation marks
- Broken grammar

**Translation Strategy:**
- **Allman's voice:** Calm, clinical when describing body, warm when addressing son
- **Narration:** Matter-of-fact description
- **Tim's response:** All the horror and emotion

Don't add drama to Allman. He IS the calm in the horror.

### Challenge 4: Scholarly Exposition Without Losing Audience

**The Problem:**
Allman delivers long paragraphs of scientific/historical exposition:

```
はるかむかしすい星から放たれる光を使ったバイオ技術があって、人々はその力を使い自由に動植物を作りだしていた。例えばラクダが長期間飲まず食わずで生きていられるのはさばくを移動する乗り物として作られたからだ。やがて人はこの力を兵器として利用できることに気づき、まものが次々と生みだされた。まもなく世界ははめつのききにおちいった…そのとき人類の存亡をかけて作り出された光とヤミの戦士。それがお前たちの先祖なのだ。
```

**This is ONE continuous speech block.**

**English readers might:**
- Lose interest in long paragraph
- Get confused by complex sentence structure
- Miss emotional weight under technical language

**Bad Solution:**
Simplify/shorten to make "easier":
- ❌ "Long ago, people used biotech. They made animals. Then they made weapons. The world almost ended. That's when your ancestors were made."

**Why This Fails:**
- Loses Allman's scholarly voice
- Reduces complex history to bullets
- Makes him sound simplistic
- Loses building rhythm of original

**Good Solution:**
Preserve length and complexity, but structure for clarity:

```
In the distant past, there existed biotechnology that used light emitted from the comet.
People used this power to create plants and animals freely, as they desired.
For example—the camel can survive long periods without food or water because it was designed as a vehicle for crossing the desert.
Eventually, humans realized this power could be used to create weapons, and demons were produced one after another.
Soon, the world stood at the brink of destruction...
At that time, staking humanity's very survival, the Warriors of Light and Darkness were created.
They are your ancestors.
```

**Techniques Used:**
1. **Break into shorter sentences** - but keep flow with conjunctions
2. **Preserve logical structure** - "In the past" → "For example" → "Eventually" → "Soon" → "At that time"
3. **Maintain academic vocabulary** - "biotechnology," "designed," "staking humanity's survival"
4. **Use em-dashes** - for pedagogical examples ("For example—")
5. **Keep building rhythm** - sentences get shorter as crisis intensifies
6. **Preserve final emphasis** - "That is your ancestor" gets own sentence

**Allman is a teacher.** His explanations should feel like good lecture:
- Clear structure
- Concrete examples
- Building toward revelation
- But not dumbed down

### Challenge 5: The Ellipsis Must Carry Emotional Weight

**Japanese uses "…" after ~60% of Allman's statements.**

**English tendency:** "Clean up" ellipses into periods for "readability."

**This destroys Allman's voice.**

**The Ellipsis Functions:**

**1. Emotional Weight He Cannot Express:**
```
大きくなったなあかわいいぼうずだったのに。
You've grown so much. You were such a small boy...
```
The ellipsis carries: "and I wasn't there to see it, and I'm sorry, and I miss you."

**2. Telepathic Communication Strain:**
```
すい星が近づいている…テム..はやくはや.く…
The comet is approaching... Tim... quickly, quick..ly...
```
The ellipses show consciousness fading, signal breaking up.

**3. Cosmic Truth Too Vast for Clean Endings:**
```
まもなく世界ははめつのききにおちいった…
Soon, the world stood at the brink of destruction...
```
The ellipsis says: "there's more to this story than I can express."

**4. Gentle Trailing Off:**
```
さあ静かに目を閉じなさい…
Well, please quietly close your eyes...
```
The ellipsis creates soothing, not abrupt, ending.

**Translation Rule:**
**Preserve ellipses.** They are not decoration.

**When NOT to use ellipsis:**
- Factual statements that need clarity: "That is your ancestor."
- Commands that need firmness: "Pick up the stones."
- Questions seeking answer: "Are Laura's pies good?"

**When TO use ellipsis:**
- Emotional statements
- Incomplete thoughts
- Telepathic strain
- Gentle trailing
- Implications beyond words

**Test:** Read aloud. Does ellipsis create meaningful pause? Keep it.

### Challenge 6: Pronouns and Relationship Dynamics

**The お前 (omae) Problem:**

Japanese: お前 explicitly marks Tim as inferior to Allman (father > son)
English: "You" is neutral, doesn't show relationship

**Cannot translate as:**
- "My son" (too explicit, Japanese leaves it implicit)
- "Boy" (too dismissive)
- "Child" (too distancing)
- "Tim" (loses intimate pronoun choice)

**Solution:**
Use "you" but ensure CONTEXT shows relationship:
- Father identifies self: "Your father, Allman"
- Uses parental imperatives: commands with gentle tone
- References shared past: "You were such a small boy"

**The 私 (watashi) Consistency:**

Allman never shifts first-person pronoun. Always "私."

English: "I" is only option.

**Maintain consistency:**
- Never "me and my colleagues" (he acts alone)
- Never "we researchers" (personalizes his work)
- Always "I discovered," "I succeeded," "I'll entrust"

Shows individual identity persisting through death.

### Challenge 7: Respecting the Incomplete Sentence (Chapter 31 Journal)

**Japanese:**
```
私はピラミッドへ足を運びこれと同じ文字板を発見した。そして…
I visited the pyramid and discovered a tablet with the same script. And then...
```

**This is deliberately incomplete.**

**Translation Temptation:**
Complete the thought:
- ❌ "And then I found the Tower"
- ❌ "And then everything changed"
- ❌ "And then I discovered the truth"

**Why resist:**
The incompleteness IS the point.
- We know what happened (he died)
- He didn't know when writing
- The cutoff is his death
- Finishing it violates narrative tension

**Correct Translation:**
```
I visited the pyramid and discovered a tablet with the same script. And then...
```

End with ellipsis. Let it hang. Don't explain.

**The reader should feel:**
"And then what? What did you find? Oh no... that's where the journal ends because he died."

Suspense, horror, tragedy - all in the trailing ellipsis.

## Special Considerations for Editors and AI

### Allman is NOT a Villain

**Common Misreading:**
"Father sends son into danger → bad parent → antagonist force"

**Actual Situation:**
- Allman dead before contacting Tim
- Cannot act physically
- Can only guide verbally
- Would protect Tim if possible
- Sends Tim to danger because only Tim can succeed
- Hates necessity but accepts it

**Evidence of Love:**
- Chapter 5: Remembers Tim as small child with affection
- Chapter 5: Asks about Laura's pies (shows care about mundane happiness)
- Chapter 32: Praises Tim's efforts
- Chapter 35: Explains everything gently, patient teacher
- Chapter 36: Releases Tim to normal life

**Editorial Directive:**
- Never frame Allman as manipulative
- Never suggest he's using Tim
- He's torn between love and necessity
- Preserve this tension in tone

### Allman is NOT Purely Tragic

**Avoid:**
- Overwhelming pathos
- Constant sadness
- Melodramatic sorrow

**While Allman:**
- Lost his body
- Lost year with son
- Died painfully

**He Also:**
- Gained cosmic knowledge
- Sees all time
- Guides humanity's salvation
- Reunites with son (spiritually)
- Completes his research

**This is bittersweet, not pure tragedy.**

**Tone Balance:**
- Sadness about loss: 30%
- Acceptance of reality: 40%
- Pride in son and mission: 30%

**He's not wallowing - he's functioning.**

### The "God" Comparison is Humble, Not Arrogant

**Chapter 36:**
```
人はこういう体を神と呼ぶのかもしれない。
People might call a body like this a god.
```

**Easy Misreading:** Allman claiming divinity, arrogant

**Actual Meaning:**
- "かもしれない" (might) = speculation, not assertion
- "人は" (people) = others might say, not self-description
- He's observing what others might think
- NOT claiming superiority

**Context:**
He's explaining why he can see past/future.
- Not: "I am a god, worship me"
- But: "This state people might consider god-like, which is why I can see everything"

**Editorial Directive:**
Preserve humility in this statement.
Don't make it sound like boast.

### Allman's Science is Real Science

**Chapter 35 Biotechnology Explanation:**

The Japanese uses:
- バイオ技術 (biotechnology)
- 進化 (evolution)
- 動植物 (flora and fauna)
- 兵器 (weapons)

**These are modern scientific terms in JRPG fantasy setting.**

**This is deliberate genre blend:**
- Not magic, but science
- Not sorcery, but biotechnology
- Not mystical, but evolutionary

**Translation Directive:**
- Keep scientific vocabulary
- Don't replace "biotechnology" with "ancient magic"
- Don't replace "evolution" with "transformation"
- The science-fantasy blend is intentional

**Why:**
Game's theme is "too-fast progress → destruction"
Only works if it's actual technology/science
Magic doesn't have moral implications
Science does

### The Flute is a Character Link, Not Magic Item

**Allman communicates through flute in Chapter 5.**

**This isn't:**
- Magic flute spell
- Enchanted item
- Random plot device

**This is:**
- Item Allman GAVE to Tim
- Found in Babel Tower (where Allman is)
- Physical link between father and son
- Conduit for telepathy because of personal connection

**Translation Directive:**
- Narration should establish connection
- "From the flute, a familiar voice" (emphasize familiarity)
- Not "The magic flute spoke" (impersonal, wrong)

**The flute matters because it's from father to son, not because it's magical.**

---

## Conclusion: Allman's Voice as Tragic Redemption

Allman's character arc:
1. Passionate researcher seeking truth
2. Died finding it
3. Consciousness persists in pain
4. Guides son to complete mission
5. Finds redemption in son's success
6. Releases son to live

His voice reflects:
- **Scholar:** Logical, explanatory, uses technical vocabulary
- **Father:** Warm, protective, uses gentle imperatives
- **Deceased:** Calm acceptance, clinical about body
- **Transcendent:** Gains cosmic perspective, sees all time

**Core Duality:** Educator + Father in every line

**For Translators:**
- Preserve three-register voice (don't smooth)
- Maintain telepathic markers (clear but not clumsy)
- Balance warmth with horror (let facts speak)
- Respect scholarly tone (don't simplify)
- Preserve ellipses (emotional weight)
- Use "entrust" for たくす (sacred responsibility)

**For Editors:**
- Allman loves Tim despite sending him to danger
- His tragedy has redemption through knowledge gained
- "God" comparison is humble observation
- Science terminology is intentional
- Flute is personal link, not magic

**For AI Assistants:**
Allman speaks in paragraphs (exposition) AND fragments (emotion).
He's calm explaining cosmic horror - don't add drama he doesn't feel.
He's tender despite being rotted corpse - don't lose warmth.
He shifts between father/scholar/prophet within same speech - don't force consistency.
Trust the contradiction - it IS the character.

**His final message to Tim (and to us):**
Knowledge has cost, but seeking it is human.
Death is transformation, not ending.
Father's love persists beyond body, time, reality itself.
"さあ地球へ向かいなさい。" (Well, head toward Earth.) = Go live your life.

That is Allman: The scholar who died for truth, the father who loved beyond death.
