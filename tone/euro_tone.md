# Euro Tone Document

## Overview

Euro (エウロ) represents the game's most sophisticated examination of capitalism, corporate exploitation, and moral compromise. The city is introduced as a great metropolis (大都市) that "far exceeds Tim's imagination," but this grandeur masks systematic human trafficking operations run by a corporation that appears legitimate on the surface. The chapters culminate in one of the game's most shocking revelations: Neil's parents have been replaced by demons (月の種族), forcing Neil to confront whether to live for himself or dedicate his life to repairing his family's legacy of harm.

## Core Thematic Structure

### The Commercial Metropolis
- **Scale and Bustle**: "大都市で人々はみないそがしそうに動きまわっている" (a metropolis where people all look busy running around everywhere)
- **Economic Power**: The Reuleck Corporation (ローレック株式会社) dominates the city's economy
- **Surface Legitimacy**: Office workers, merchants, market stalls - the appearance of normal commerce
- **Celebration Culture**: Neil's return triggers fireworks and festivities, showing wealth and spectacle

### The Corporate Evil
Unlike Freejia's visible back streets, Euro's darkness operates through:
- **Bureaucratic Language**: Business transactions that include "労働力や女も" (labor, even women) spoken in professional tones
- **Compartmentalization**: Different employees handle different parts, no one sees the whole picture
- **Respectability**: The corporation is praised by townspeople for bringing prosperity
- **Hidden Infrastructure**: Basement facilities beneath a chapel, groaning from cargo shipments

### The Intellectual Sphere
- **Rofski and Elazquez**: World-famous scholar and violinist who constantly quarrel
- **Prophecy and Legend**: Books predicting humanity's future, myths about sacred tears
- **Fortune-telling**: NPCs discuss comet predictions and apocalyptic prophecies
- **The Tearpot Quest**: Ancient artifacts revealing true forms

## Speech Pattern Analysis by Character Type

### 1. Tim (Narrator) - Growing Awareness

**Japanese Characteristics:**
- **Observation**: "ぼくの想像をはるかに越えた大都市" (a metropolis that far exceeded my imagination)
- **Simple Recording**: "ニールの両親の住むおやしき。ぼくらは客間にとおされた" (The mansion where Neil's parents live. We were led to the guest room)
- **Distance from Horror**: Doesn't editorialize what he witnesses in the slave chambers

**Tone**: Tim maintains narrative composure even when documenting corporate atrocities, showing his maturation from innocent observer to someone who can witness evil without breaking

### 2. Neil - Moral Crisis Central

**Early Chapter - Returning Home:**
- Casual, friendly: "じゃあこの部屋でゆっくりしててくれよ" (Well, while you're in this room, please take it easy)
- Familial warmth: "ぼくは両親としばらく話してくる。もう３年ぶりだしね" (I'll talk to my parents for a little bit. It's already been three years, hasn't it?)

**Mid Chapter - Philosophical Questioning:**
- "自分のために生きるべきか人のために生きるべきかってことだよな…" (I guess it's a matter of whether I should live for my own sake or live for the sake of other people...)
- Uses "べき" (should) - moral imperative language
- Trailing ellipsis shows unresolved internal debate

**Post-Revelation - Broken:**
- "……….." (extended ellipsis - speechlessness)
- "しばらく家をはなれていてやっと親のありがたさがわかったというのに…" (Even though I understood how my parents had welcomed me after I had been separated from my family...)
- "テム…悪いけどしばらく一人にしておいてくれ…" (Tim... It might be inconveniencing you, but could you leave me alone for a while...?)
- **Narrator's Commentary**: "うつむいてしまった…ぼくはこんなニールを見るのは初めてだった…" (hung his head... It was the first time I had ever seen Neil like this...)

**Resolution - Determined:**
- "一晩中考えたんだけど" (I've been thinking about it all night)
- "この会社はやっぱりぼくがつがなきゃいけないと思うんだ" (this company can't continue unless I inherit it)
- "なんとかしてドレイ貿易をやめさせたい" (I want to do something to stop the slave trade)
- "まずドレイ貿易を始めた会社が動くべきだと思う" (the company that first established that slave trade should work towards it)
- Shifting from "べきか" (should I?) to "べきだ" (I should) - from question to declaration

**Embarrassed Acceptance:**
- "えへへ。なんだか照れちゃうな" (Hehe. I'm feeling kind of embarrassed for some reason)
- Brief return to boyishness before taking on adult responsibility

**Tone Arc**: Casual → Philosophical → Devastated → Resolved → Mature. Neil transforms from wealthy kid to someone choosing obligation over freedom.

### 3. Karen - Social Observer and Emotional Support

**Initial Reaction:**
- "すっごい家よね…" (It's an amaaazing house, isn't it...?)
- "最近は国王より民間人の方がお金もちなのかしら…" (I suppose that there are citizens that have more money than kings as of late...)
- Uses "すっごい" (elongated すごい) for emphasis
- "かしら" (wondering) maintains her thoughtful feminine speech

**After Neil's Decision:**
- "じゃニールは社長になるわけね？すごおおおおい！！" (So, that must mean Neil's going to become the president of the company? Cooooool!!)
- Extended "すごおおおおい" shows genuine excitement for friend
- Multiple exclamation marks - emotionally supportive

**Reunion with Peggy:**
- "ペギーっ！！！" (Peggy...!) - pure joy
- "どうしたのっ？！元気だった？！" (How?! Was she okay?!) - rapid questions, genuine concern

**Setting Next Destination:**
- "さあいってみましょ！！" (Alright, let's go check it out!)
- Takes initiative, forward momentum

**Tone**: Karen remains emotionally intelligent and socially aware, providing both commentary on wealth disparity and enthusiastic support for Neil's choice.

### 4. Eric - Comic Relief with Perspective

**House Observation:**
- "こんな広い家だと夜おしっこにいきたくなったらどうするんだろ…" (This house is so huge, I wonder what I'll do if I want to go pee at night...)
- Childish concern grounds the mansion's absurd wealth
- "どうするんだろ" (what will I do) - genuine practical worry

**After Peggy Arrives:**
- "女の子ってつくづくわかんないよ" (I don't understand girls at all)
- "つくづく" (really, deeply) - exasperation
- Simple masculine speech maintains his child perspective

**Tone**: Eric provides necessary levity and child's-eye perspective on adult complications.

### 5. Neil's Parents - Superficial Warmth

**Before Revelation:**
- "あたしたちはもうお金もいっぱいもうけたしあとは余生を遊んでくらしたいのよ" (Since we already earn a lot of money, we want you to be able to just have fun for the rest of your life)
- "後をついでくれないかねえ.." (Won't you succeed us..?)
- Polite but manipulative, using "かねえ" (soft insistence)

**After Revelation (Moon Tribe):**
- "クックククククク…" (Mweheheheheheheh...) - villainous laughter
- "もうじきこの世界もヤミにつつまれる" (Darkness will soon envelop this world, too)
- "さっきの体の持ち主は礼拝堂の地下で骨となってねむっているよ" (The owners of the bodies we were using a moment ago have become bones sleeping in the basement of the chapel)
- Complete tonal shift from warm parents to cold demons
- Use of "よ" at end - casual revelation of murder, showing callousness

**Tone**: The contrast creates retroactive horror - every warm moment was a lie.

### 6. Corporate Employees - Compartmentalized Evil

**Public Face:**
- "お客さまっ！こっちは出口でございます。入口の方へまわってください！" (Dear customer..! This is the exit. Please head to the entrance!)
- Polite service language (でございます)
- Professional, accommodating

**Private Business Discussion:**
- "会社の人：ええ。うちは何でもやってますよ。お茶やくだものから毛皮…" (Company person: Yeah. We do everything. From tea and fruit through to animal pelts...)
- "あとは大きい声では言えませんが労働力や女も…" (Don't say it openly, but we also deal in labour, even in women...)
- "あわわ….なんだ子供か…." (U-umm... What's with this kid...?)
- "おじさんたちはお仕事の話をしてるんだからあっちへいってなさい！" (Some middle-aged guys are talking about work, so please go play outside or something!)

**Linguistic Notes:**
- Shift from polite customer service to casual criminal business
- "大きい声では言えませんが" (can't say openly) - awareness of wrongdoing
- Flustered when caught by child
- Return to dismissive adult-to-child language

**Tone**: Professional polish masking systematic evil; when exposed, becomes defensive and dismissive.

### 7. The Slaves - Broken Speech and Testimony

**Language Barrier Acknowledgment:**
- "わたし少しだけ言葉わかる" (I understand a little of your language)
- Simple, broken grammar shows forced language learning
- "わたしたち遠い場所からここへつれてこられた…" (We were brought here from a distant place...)

**The System:**
- "わたしたちここで言葉を教えこまれまた別のところへ売られていく…" (We are forced to learn language here, and then are sold off to separate places...)
- "教えこまれ" (forced to be taught) - passive, coercive
- "売られていく" (are sold) - passive voice emphasizes lack of agency

**Fear:**
- "そこにころがっている骨わたしたちの仲間…命令にしたがわないとそうなる" (The bones scattered over there were our companions... If we don't obey an order, that's how it will be for us)
- Simple, matter-of-fact statement of horror

**Suppression:**
- "母国の言葉しゃべりたい..でもそうするとたたかれる…" (I want to talk in the language of my motherland... But I'll be beaten if I do that...)
- Double ellipsis - yearning and fear

**Homeland Devastation:**

- "ひどい病気だと体が石にかわっていくものもある…." (There is even an awful disease where the body is turned into stone...)
- "だからわたしドレイとしてでも遠くの国ににげる…" (So I'm escaping to another country, even if it means becoming a slave...)

**Linguistic Analysis:**
- Minimal particles, simplified grammar
- Yet emotionally articulate despite language barriers
- "ドレイとしてでも" (even as a slave) - "でも" shows desperate acceptance
- Choosing slavery over stone plague - unimaginable choice stated simply

**Tone**: Devastatingly dignified. The broken Japanese doesn't diminish their humanity but emphasizes the violence of forced assimilation. Their testimony is clinical and emotional simultaneously.

### 8. The Intellectual Duo - Rofski and Elazquez

**The Quarrel:**

**Rofski:**
- "何が天才バイオリニストじゃ！天災みたいな音をたておってっ！！" (What sort of genius violinist are you? You're at your best when you take your bow and get off the stage..!!)
- Wordplay: "天才" (genius) vs "天災" (natural disaster) - sophisticated insult
- Old man speech: "じゃ" ending

**Elazquez:**
- "ふん！おまえこそウソばかり書きちらす三文モノカキのくせに大口たたくなっ！！" (Hmph! I guess two-bit writers always talk big...!!)
- "三文モノカキ" (two-bit hack writer) - contemptuous
- "大口たたく" (talk big) - calling out pretension

**Tone**: Simultaneously petty and intellectual. These are geniuses behaving like children, but their knowledge proves crucial.

**Rofski - The Scholar:**
- "今口論になっておったのはケレス山の聖域にまつられているティアポットのことなんじゃよ" (We started arguing because of the Tearpot enshrined in the holy grounds of Mount Kehres)
- "ケレス山にはかつて神の流したなみだが安置されていてな、それが人類を救うという言い伝えがあるんじゃ" (I believe that the tears shed by the gods were once enshrined at Mount Kehres; there's a legend that they will save mankind)
- Archaic scholarly tone: "なんじゃよ", "てな", "なんじゃ"
- Belief language: "言い伝え" (legend/tradition)

**After Seeing Tearpot:**
- "おおそれこそティアポット…実在するものであったのか…" (Oh, that is definitely the Tearpot... It really exists, does it...?)
- Wonder and validation - scholarly hypothesis confirmed

**Elazquez - The Blind Seer:**
- "そこのお前…そなたからは何か不思議な力を感じる…" (You there... I feel from thee a mysterious power...)
- Uses "そなた" (archaic "you") - formal, mystical
- "わしの目はもう見えんのじゃがそうなると感がさえてきてな特別なものにはびんかんに反応するんじゃよ" (I'm already blind, but since I've lost my sight, I've developed a keen sense for things that are clearly special)
- "見えん" (cannot see) - archaic negative
- Compensatory senses - classic blind seer trope

**Demon Warning:**
- "町のいずこからかまものの気配がただよってくる…" (The presence of demons is the air in this town...)
- "いずこからか" (from somewhere) - literary language
- "わしはまものが町の人にすりかわっているような気がするんじゃよ" (I feel that demons have switched places with some of the townspeople)
- "すりかわる" (switch/exchange) - body-snatching concept
- "それは広場の往来の人かもしれんしお前の友達かもしれんしわしかもしれん" (It might be people travelling through the plaza, it might be your friend, it might be me)
- Escalating paranoia - could be anyone, even himself

**Instructions:**
- "お前があやしいと思う人物にティアポットを使ってみるがよい" (You should try to use the Tearpot on characters that you think are suspicious)
- "がよい" - archaic advice-giving

**Tone**: Both scholars use archaic, formal Japanese that marks them as educated and aged. Elazquez's blindness becomes mystical sight, while Rofski's bookish knowledge proves practical. Their quarreling masks deep wisdom.

### 9. Market NPCs - Economic Reality

**General Merchants:**
- "こらこらこっち側にきちゃダメだよ。お客さんは反対側にまわっておくれっ！" (Hey, hey, you mustn't come on this side. Customers should turn to the opposite side...!)
- Familiar, scolding tone: "こらこら", "〜ちゃダメ"
- "おくれっ" (please/go ahead) - working-class casual

- "女たちは夫を兵士として送り出したあとなみだをこのツボにためて帰りをまっていたというエピソードのあるものなんだ" (There's an anecdote that women collected their tears in these pots while they waited for their husbands to return from the war)
- Historical storytelling, connecting merchandise to tragedy
- Commodifying grief - tears become sellable objects

**The Apple Vendor:**
- "そんなほしそうな目をして…わかったわよ。一つあげるわ" (You're looking at me like you want something... I understand. I'll give you one of these apples)
- Feminine speech: "わかったわよ", "あげるわ"
- Kindness breaking through commercial transactions

**Company Supporter:**
- "この町がうるおっているのはローレック株式会社のおかげ" (This town flourishes by the grace of the Reuleck Corporation)
- "悪いうわさもけっこうあるけどぼくはやっぱりあの会社はすごいと思いますよ" (There are more than enough bad rumours about them, too, but I still think the company is amazing)
- "けっこうあるけど" (quite a few, but) - acknowledges problems but dismisses
- Economic dependence overriding moral concerns

**Skeptical Citizen:**
- "この町もずいぶん変わったよ。ローレック株式会社が世界的に急成長してからここは商人たちのきょ点となっちまった" (The Reuleck Corporation has even caused this town to change terribly. It's become a base for merchants due to the company's global growth)
- "ずいぶん変わった" (changed considerably) - not positive
- "急成長する会社っていうのは必ず何か裏があるもんさね" (There's always something hiding behind a growing company, isn't there?)
- "裏がある" (has a hidden side) - suspicion without action

**Woman Who Saw:**
- "あたし見ちゃったの…礼拝堂の地下にたくさんの人が閉じこめられているのを…" (I saw... A lot of people imprisoned in basement of the chapel...)
- "見ちゃった" (saw [accidentally/regretfully])
- Ellipses show fear of speaking openly

**Tone**: Market NPCs range from cheerful commerce to fearful whispers. Some defend the company despite "rumors," others hint at dark knowledge, creating an atmosphere of willful ignorance and economic dependence.

### 10. Ann - The Blackmailer

**Discovery:**
- "何日か前のことだけど青黒いマントをはおった男が入ってきてね" (So, a man wearing a dark blue mantle came here a few ago)
- "カレンという娘がこの町にきてないかって言うのよ" (He was asking if a girl named Karen hadn't come to this city)
- "あのこおりそうな目を見ただけであたしちぢみあがっちゃった" (I cowered from the way he glared with his icy eyes)
- "こおりそうな目" (freezing eyes) - threatening presence
- "ちぢみあがる" (shrink/cower) - visceral fear

**The Choice:**
- "このことカレンに話してもいいんだけどさ… ／ 勝手にすれば！ ／ お願いだから話さないでくれっ！" (It might be good to tell this to Karen, but... / If that's what you want! / Please don't tell, I'm begging you!)
- Game presents moral choice
- "勝手にすれば" (Do as you please) - defiance
- "お願いだから" (I'm begging you) - desperation

**Petty Cruelty:**
- "あのカレンって娘どことなくおじょう様ぶってて気にくわないのよ" (I can't stomach how that Karen girl acts like such a little lady)
- "おじょう様ぶる" (acts like a little lady) - class resentment

- "あーあ。あたしリンゴが食べたいなあ。市場で買ってきてっ！" (Aah. I think I want to eat some apples. Go buy them from the market for me!)
- Childish manipulation, wielding power over Tim

**Resolution After Apples:**
- "どうしてそんなに何度も市場と往復してリンゴをもってきてくれるの..？" (Why do you keep going back and forth to the market like this, bringing apples for me as many times as I ask..?)
- "カレンっていう女の子のため..？それとも…？" (Is it for that Karen girl..? Or...?)
- Softening - recognizing devotion
- "まあいいわ。おれいにこの宝石をあげる" (Well, that's alright. As thanks, I'll give you this jewel)
- "カレンを大切にしてあげてね…" (Take good care of Karen, alright...?)
- Complete emotional reversal - from blackmailer to romantic supporter

**Tone**: Ann represents petty evil (class resentment, manipulation) but proves redeemable through witnessing genuine devotion. Her arc parallels the larger corporate evil - individuals within corrupt systems can choose differently.

### 11. Miscellaneous NPCs - World Building

**The Guard:**
- "これはローレック株式会社の社長夫妻の住むおやしきです" (This is the mansion where the married couple that serve as the presidents of the Reuleck Corporation live)
- Formal, informative
- "何日か前にブラックパンサーとか名乗る男がふらりとやってきていろいろと聞きまわっていたよ" (A man named Black Panther or something like that popped up some days ago and went around asking various questions)
- "あの目つきは殺し屋にまちがいないなあ。いったいだれを追っているんだか" (From the look in his eyes, he's got to be an assassin. He could be after someone, but I have no idea who)
- Casual speculation about assassin - normalized danger

**Fortune-Telling Believer:**
- "あのね。未来をうらなってもらったら真っ暗なんですって…" (That's how it is, is it? So you're saying that if you have your future told, it's might be a dark future...)
- "ものすごく大きいほうき星が地のふちをかすめて人間は死に絶えるんですって.." (An extremely huge comet is grazing across the Earth... They say that people will die off…)
- "もうこうなったらやけ食いするしかないわっ！！" (Well, if that's how it is, all I'm going to do from now on is binge eat...!!)
- Apocalyptic prophecy → comfort eating
- "やけ食い" (stress eating) - coping mechanism

**Explorer Friesel:**
- "私は探険家のフリーゼル" (I am Friesel, the explorer)
- "いだいなる探険家オールマンがバベルの塔を発見したように私も歴史に名を残すつもりだよ" (I want history to remember my name, just like when the now-famous Allman discovered the Tower of Babel)
- Grandiose ambition
- References in-game lore (Tower of Babel)

**Tone**: Minor NPCs build atmosphere of normalcy masking crisis - prophecies of doom, assassins asking questions, explorers seeking glory, all while slavery operates beneath.

## Thematic Analysis

### Corporate Evil vs. Personal Evil

**Corporate:**
- Systematic, bureaucratic
- Compartmentalized (different employees handle different parts)
- Legitimized through economic benefit to city
- Hidden behind professional language and customer service

**Personal (Ann):**
- Petty, immediate
- Class resentment-driven
- Redeemable through witnessing genuine love

**Synthesis**: The game shows how individual small evils (Ann's blackmail) exist within larger systematic evils (corporate slave trade), but individuals can break from systems while systems require structural change.

### Living for Self vs. Living for Others

**Neil's Central Question:**
- "自分のために生きるべきか人のために生きるべきかってことだよな…" (whether I should live for my own sake or live for the sake of other people)

**His Resolution:**
- "人の不幸とひきかえにお金を手に入れたってしかたがないしね" (there's no way around exchanging human misery for money [in the past], but I can change this)
- Choosing obligation to repair harm over personal freedom
- Staying behind while party continues adventure

**Contrast with Slaves:**
- Slaves have no choice
- Neil has wealth, privilege, freedom - chooses responsibility
- Privilege creating obligation to repair privilege's harm

### Prophecy and Apocalypse

**Multiple Warnings:**
- Rofski's book: "人類の未来を予言している" (predictions about the future of humanity)
- Comet prophecy: "ものすごく大きいほうき星が地のふちをかすめて" (extremely huge comet grazing Earth)
- Elazquez sensing demons: "まものが町の人にすりかわっている" (demons have switched places with townspeople)
- Moon Tribe: "もうじきこの世界もヤミにつつまれる" (Darkness will soon envelop this world)

**Synthesis**: Euro exists at intersection of economic exploitation and cosmic horror - the apocalypse may be both social (systematic evil) and literal (comet/darkness).

### Sacred vs. Profane

**Sacred:**
- Tearpot with god's tears: "神の流したなみだ" (tears shed by the gods)
- Mount Kehres holy grounds: "聖域" (sacred area)
- Chapel imagery (though corrupted)
- Tears saving humanity: "人類を救う" (will save mankind)

**Profane:**
- Chapel basement: slave chambers
- Tearpot as commodity: sold in marketplace
- Corporate transactions: "女も" (even women) as tradeable goods
- Demons wearing flesh: parents' bodies stolen

**Synthesis**: The sacred is both commodified (Tearpots for sale) and necessary (actual Tearpot reveals truth). Religion's symbols exist in marketplace but retain power.

## Translation Considerations

### 1. Neil's Emotional Arc - Critical Priority
Neil's journey from casual confidence → philosophical questioning → devastating loss → mature resolution is THE emotional core. Translation must track:

- **Casual**: Natural, friendly teenage speech
- **Philosophical**: "べきか" must read as genuine moral questioning, not pretentious
- **Devastated**: The extended ellipsis "……….." requires equivalent visual silence
- **Resolved**: Shift from question ("should I?") to declaration ("I should") must be clear
- **Embarrassed**: "えへへ" moment of boyishness before accepting adult burden

### 2. Slave Testimonies - Dignity in Brokenness
The slaves speak broken Japanese but articulate complex thoughts:
- "わたし少しだけ言葉わかる" - grammatically simple
- But: "ドレイとしてでも遠くの国ににげる" (escaping even as a slave) - philosophically complex

**Translation must:**
- Show language barrier without making them seem stupid
- Preserve their dignity and intelligence
- Maintain emotional weight of testimony
- "でも" (even though/even as) must convey desperate acceptance

### 3. Corporate Double-Speak
Employees shift between:
- "でございます" (humble professional) to customers
- "労働力や女も" (labor, even women) in private
- "大きい声では言えませんが" (can't say openly) - awareness of crime

**Translation must:**
- Show professional polish
- Contrast with casual cruelty
- Maintain "open secret" quality - they know it's wrong but do it anyway

### 4. The Scholarly Duo
Rofski and Elazquez use archaic Japanese:
- "なんじゃよ", "じゃが", "そなた"
- Sophisticated insults: "天才" vs "天災" wordplay
- Wisdom emerging from petty quarrels

**Translation must:**
- Mark them as aged and educated without sounding ridiculous
- Preserve their bickering dynamic
- Maintain mystical quality (especially Elazquez's blindness = sight)
- Make Tearpot quest feel mythologically significant

### 5. Ann's Redemption Arc
Ann shifts from:
- Petty blackmailer ("えへへ。弱みをにぎっちゃった")
- To genuinely moved ("どうしてそんなに何度も〜?")
- To romantic supporter ("カレンを大切にしてあげてね")

**Translation must:**
- Make her initial cruelty feel petty, not evil
- Show her genuine surprise at Tim's devotion
- Land emotional reversal without feeling cheap

### 6. The Revelation Scene
Moon Tribe reveal must:
- Contrast completely with earlier warmth
- "クックククク" laugh pattern - villain signature
- "骨となってねむっているよ" - casual mention of murder, showing callousness
- "もうじきこの世界もヤミにつつまれる" - apocalyptic threat

**Neil's reaction:**
- "……….." - extended silence
- "しばらく一人にしておいてくれ" - need for solitude
- Narrator: "こんなニールを見るのは初めてだった" - unprecedented brokenness

### 7. Mount Kehres Atmosphere
Sacred grounds description:
- "不思議場な所" (mysterious place) - typo in original or dialect?
- "何倍もあるキノコが乱立し" (mushrooms several times my size crowded together)
- "見たこともない植物のクキ" (plant stalks I'd never seen)

**Translation must:**
- Create otherworldly atmosphere
- Maintain sense of scale (giant mushrooms)
- Connect to earlier NPC memories of playing there as children

### 8. Formality Levels

**Very Polite (です/ます + humble forms):**
- Customer service: "でございます"
- Slaves pleading (when they know enough language)

**Polite (です/ます):**
- General NPCs
- Public business discussions

**Casual (だ/である):**
- Friends (Neil, Karen, Eric to each other)
- Private business discussions
- Most narration

**Archaic:**
- Scholars (なんじゃよ, じゃが)
- Mystical contexts

**Broken:**

## Narrative Function

Euro serves multiple purposes:

1. **Neil's Character Climax**: His personal arc concludes, choosing responsibility over adventure
2. **Corporate Evil Revelation**: Shows systematic exploitation operating through legitimate business
3. **Demon Infiltration**: Moon Tribe replacing humans, preparing Darkness's spread
4. **Power Acquisition**: Aura Barrier, Dark Power, Tearpot
5. **Party Transformation**: Neil leaves, Peggy joins, group dynamics shift
6. **Thematic Deepening**: From individual evil (Freejia slavers) to systematic evil (corporate structure)
7. **Moral Complexity**: Tim can choose to help Ann or defy her, showing ongoing ethical testing
8. **World-Building**: Shows how apocalypse manifests - not just monsters but demons wearing human flesh, corporations trafficking humans

## Conclusion: Euro's Moral Architecture

Euro represents Illusion of Gaia's most sophisticated critique of power and complicity. Unlike Freijia's visible horror (back streets, mines), Euro's evil operates through:

- **Professional language** masking crimes
- **Economic benefits** silencing dissent  
- **Compartmentalization** distributing responsibility
- **Legitimate fronts** (corporation, chapel) hiding darkness
- **Demons** literally wearing respectable faces

The Japanese text creates this through:

**Linguistic Stratification:**
- Corporate professionals shifting registers (polite to criminal)
- Slaves' broken but dignified testimony
- Scholars' archaic wisdom
- Neil's evolution from casual to philosophical to determined

**Tonal Layering:**
- Surface: Commercial bustle, friendly service, celebration
- Middle: Whispers, warnings, rumors
- Deep: Slave chambers, demon revelation, corporate trafficking

**Character Voice Precision:**
- Neil's "べきか" → "べきだ" (should I? → I should) tracking moral evolution
- Ann's redemption through simple kindness recognition
- Slaves' "ドレイとしてでも" (even as a slave) showing impossible choices
- Moon Tribe's casual "骨となってねむっているよ" (sleeping as bones) revealing callousness

**Thematic Synthesis:**
The game asks: When evil operates through systems rather than individuals, how do you resist?

**Neil's answer:** Inherit the system to reform it. Use privilege to repair privilege's harm.

**The game's answer:** Individual choices matter (Ann's redemption, Tim's devotion, Neil's sacrifice) but systemic change requires institutional power.

**The translation must preserve:**
1. Neil's emotional devastation and recovery arc
2. The horror of demons casually revealing they killed and replaced his parents
3. Slaves' dignity despite linguistic and circumstantial breaking
4. Corporate evil's professional polish
5. The scholars' quarrelsome wisdom
6. Ann's petty-to-profound transformation
7. The Tearpot quest's mythological weight
8. Economic language grounding fantasy in recognizable power structures
9. Neil's ultimate choice as genuine moral victory, not consolation prize

Euro shows that the apocalypse isn't just cosmic - it's already here in how humans treat each other. The comet may destroy the world, but the world is already destroying itself through exploitation. Neil can't stop the cosmic darkness, but he can fight the human darkness. That's not a small thing.

The tone must honor this complexity: celebration and slavery, scholarship and superstition, personal kindness and systematic evil, genuine love and demonic infiltration, all existing simultaneously in one city. Not contradictions to be resolved, but the truth of power - it looks respectable while doing terrible things.

When Tim narrates seeing Neil broken for the first time ("こんなニールを見るのは初めてだった"), that moment must land with full weight. This is the game saying: There are losses that break even the strongest among us, and that's okay. Neil doesn't bounce back immediately. He takes the night to process, then chooses his path.

That's Euro's gift - showing that moral heroism doesn't always look like adventure. Sometimes it looks like staying behind to clean up your family's mess, choosing obligation over freedom, inheriting not wealth but responsibility.

The translation must make readers feel what Tim feels: this is the first time I've seen my confident friend completely broken. And what Neil feels: I wanted my parents back, and I got demons wearing their skin. And what he chooses: I'll use the privilege they built on suffering to end that suffering.

That's the tone. Beautiful city, terrible truth, and the choice to stay and fight rather than run.
