# Rob (ロブ) - The Working-Class Heart - Comprehensive Tone and Voice Analysis

## Executive Summary

Rob appears across 92 dialogue entries spanning chapters 1-27, making him one of Tim's closest companions with a complete character arc from rough South Cape kid to mature young man choosing love and family. His journey traces working-class masculinity finding emotional depth: from casual playground friend, through loyal adventure companion and vulnerable amnesia victim, to romantic confessor making life-altering decisions. Despite this evolution, his core voice—rough, direct, working-class authentic—remains unwavering through specific Japanese linguistic patterns.

This document analyzes the Japanese source text to guide accurate translation and editorial decisions, with particular attention to his unique rough masculine speech patterns, father-son dynamics, and romantic evolution with Lillie.

## Critical Questions Answered

### 1. Does all this text belong to Rob?

**YES** - All 92 entries are correctly attributed to Rob. The file contains consistent Japanese markers:

**All Chapters:**
- Japanese marker: **"ロブ："** (Rob:)  
- Consistent use of "おれ" (ore) first-person pronoun throughout
- Rough speech patterns maintained across all contexts
- No misattributions found

**Verification**: Every line marked "ロブ：" exhibits Rob's characteristic rough speech patterns. The consistency of "おれ" (masculine rough) + sentence-final particles (じゃんか, だぜ, ぜ, な) + contractions (ねえ for ない) confirms all dialogue belongs to the same speaker.

### 2. What implications emerge from location/timeline analysis?

Rob's appearances mark a complete domestic arc running parallel to Tim's cosmic journey:

  - "今モリスとブラックジャックの勝負をしてるんだ。" (I'm playing blackjack with Morris right now.)

  - "友達だったら楽しみと苦労はわかちあわなくっちゃな。" (If we're friends, we have to share both joys and hardships.)
- **Crisis**: Morris's death scream, Rob's horror at losing friend
- **Implication**: Loyalty trumps safety; friendship is action, not words

**Phase 5: Freejia Reunion (Chapters 13-15) - Vulnerability Exposed**
- **Context**: Rob has amnesia from escape injury
- **Rob's State**: "自分がだれだかわからないってなんだか不思議だよ…オレがだれだかわからないのにオレはなんでここにいるんだろ。" (Not knowing who you are is strange... Even though I don't know who I am, why am I here?)
- **Recovery**: Memories return, but experience shows Rob can be broken
- **Implication**: The tough kid isn't invulnerable; others must care for him too

**Phase 6: Mid-Journey Companion (Chapters 16-21) - Growing Awareness**
- **Nazca**: "オレ３週間っていうきろくがあるけど負けてるなあ。" (I have a record of three weeks, but I'm losing.)
- **Seaside Palace**: Concern for Tim's fall, relief at survival

**Phase 7: Angel Village (Chapters 22-23) - Romantic Awakening**
- **Context**: Rob realizes he's fallen for Lillie
- **Confession to Tim**: 
  - "テムに一つそうだんがあるんだけどさ。" (I have something to discuss with you, Tim.)
  - "言いにくいんだけどおれリリィのことを好きになっちまったみたいなんだ…" (It's hard to say, but it seems I've fallen for Lillie...)
  - "夢だって彼女の夢ばっかりだし..気づくとリリィのことを目で追ってるんだよ。" (Even my dreams are all about her... Before I know it, I'm following Lillie with my eyes.)
- **Seeking Advice**: Asks Tim what gift to give for her birthday
- **Implication**: Rob's emotional growth - can admit vulnerability, seek help, recognize love

**Phase 8: Watermia Crisis (Chapter 24) - Dual Heartbreak**
- **Context**: Reunites with missing father, finds him mentally broken
- **Father's Condition**: "どうやら頭をやられちまっているみたいだ…行方不明のおやじにやっと会えたと思ったらこれだもんな.." (Looks like his head got messed up... Just when I thought I could finally meet my missing father, it's like this...)
- **Birthday Party**: Celebrates Lillie's 15th birthday with group
- **Confession**: "リリィ…君のことが好きだ…" (Lillie... I like you...)
- **Response**: Lillie runs away, overwhelmed
- **Letter to Tim**: Leaves to find Great Wall medicine alone, includes: "あそうそう…リリィにふられちまったよ。" (Oh yeah... Lillie rejected me.)
- **Implication**: Rob faces compound crisis - father sick, love rejected - responds with action (quest for cure)

**Phase 9: Great Wall Reunion (Chapter 25) - Near-Death and Acceptance**
- **Context**: Rob found near death after monster attack, saved by necklace
- **Revelation**: "この石のおかげでおれは助かったんだよな…実はこれリリィのために作ったネックレスだったんだ…" (Thanks to this stone, I was saved... Actually, this was a necklace I made for Lillie...)
- **Gift Offer**: Stone depleted but offers remaining necklace
- **Acceptance**: Lillie accepts, kisses him
- **Joy**: "いやっほーっ！！こんな気分ってはじめてだっ！！学校が夏休みになったときの１００万倍くらいうれしいよっ！" (Yahoo!! This feeling is a first for me!! I'm about 1,000,000 times happier than when school became summer vacation!)
- **Implication**: Near-death strips pretense, reveals Rob's gift was love insurance; mutual acceptance after crisis

**Phase 10: Final Choice (Chapters 26-27) - Domestic Resolution**
- **Context**: Father recovering, party must continue without Rob
- **Decision**: "みんなには悪いけどおれはここに残るよ。あんなおやじを放っておくわけにいかないしな。" (Sorry to everyone, but I'm staying here. I can't leave my old man like that.)
- **Relationship**: "おれさ。リリィとつきあうことにしたんだ。もちろんいいかげんな気持ちじゃないさ。ずっといっしょにいたいと思ってる。" (I've decided to go out with Lillie. Of course, my feelings aren't half-hearted. I want to be with her forever.)
- **Blessing**: "みんなと旅ができて楽しかったよ。テムの旅の成功をいのってるよ。" (It was fun traveling with everyone. I'm praying for Tim's journey to succeed.)
- **Later Check-in**: Father improving, gives Tim red jewel from father's belongings
- **Implication**: Rob chooses ordinary happiness (love, family, home) over extraordinary adventure (Tim's cosmic quest)

**Overall Timeline Pattern**:
Rough friend (Ch1-3) → Loyal companion (Ch6-10) → Vulnerable victim (Ch13-15) → Emotional awakening (Ch16-23) → Dual crisis (Ch24) → Near-death and love (Ch25) → Domestic choice (Ch26-27)

**Parallel Structure with Tim**:
- **Both**: Missing/lost fathers
- **Both**: Searching for fathers
- **Tim**: Father transformed to monster (cosmic tragedy)
- **Rob**: Father sick but curable (domestic hope)
- **Tim**: Must continue heroic journey, loses personal life
- **Rob**: Completes personal journey, gains family and love

This parallel shows TWO VALID PATHS - cosmic heroism vs. ordinary happiness. Rob's choice isn't failure; it's success at different goals.

### 3. How does his tone evolve over time?

Rob's voice evolves from casual roughness to emotional depth while maintaining his core linguistic patterns. Unlike Morris (who stays formal) or Lillie (whose femininity persists), Rob's evolution shows WORKING-CLASS MASCULINITY finding capacity for tenderness WITHOUT LOSING AUTHENTICITY.

**Phase 1: Casual Playground Energy (South Cape - Chapters 1-3)**

**Emotional Register**: Friendly rough, competitive, casual  
**Voice Mode**: Kid among peers, no filter  
**Sentence Patterns**: Rough casual with frequent contractions

**Typical Energy:**
```
ロブ：なんだよテム。おそかったじゃんかっ。
Rob: What's up, Tim? You're late!

今モリスとブラックジャックの勝負をしてるんだ。ちょっと待ってくれ。
I'm playing blackjack with Morris right now. Wait a sec.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"なんだよ"** - rough greeting (What's up/What is it)
- **"じゃんかっ"** - rough assertion particle (you are, aren't you!)  
- **"ちょっと待ってくれ"** - casual imperative (wait a sec)
- **No politeness** - pure casual forms

**Social Interaction:**
```
ロブ：学者モリスの言うことはむずかしくてオレにはよくわかんねーや。
Rob: Scholar Morris says things that are difficult; I don't really get it.

モリス。カード出したついでにもうひと勝負しようぜ。
Morris, since you've got cards out, let's have another match.
```

**Linguistic Features:**
- **"わかんねーや"** - rough negative contraction (ない→ねー, casual ending や)
- **"しようぜ"** - rough volitional (let's do it - masculine)
- Self-aware about limits ("I don't get it") but unbothered
- Practical focus (cards, games) vs. Morris's intellectualism

**About Karen:**
```
ロブ：そんなにあわてて飛びこんでくるからもっとすごいことが起こったのかと思ったぜ。
Rob: You rushed in so frantically, I thought something even more amazing had happened.

それに王女ってあのわがまま娘のカレンだろ。あんなヤツのどこがいいんだっ？
Besides, the princess is that selfish girl Karen, right? What's good about someone like her?
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"と思ったぜ"** - rough past assertion (I thought, you know - masculine)
- **"わがまま娘"** - blunt description (selfish girl)
- **"あんなヤツ"** - dismissive reference (someone like that - crude)
- **"いいんだっ"** - rough rhetorical question
- Shows class awareness - princess = spoiled = not impressed

**Phase 1 Summary**: Rob speaks pure working-class casual. Contractions heavy, particles rough, no social filter. Friendly but blunt. Values Morris's smarts but doesn't pretend to match them. Dismisses royalty without deference.

---

**Phase 2: Loyal Companion (Gold Ship - Chapter 10)**

**Emotional Register**: Protective concern, loyalty expressed through action  
**Voice Mode**: Friend defending friend's choices  
**Sentence Patterns**: Maintaining roughness but adding care

**Following Tim:**
```
ロブ：お前の様子が変だから３人でこっそり後をつけたんだ。
Rob: You were acting weird, so the three of us secretly followed you.

そしたら変な村にたどりついてさ…
Then we arrived at a weird village...

じゅうぶん変な村じゃねえかっ。目に見えない村なんてよっ。
Isn't it plenty weird? An invisible village and all!
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"お前"** - rough "you" (masculine, for close friends)
- **"ついてさ"** - casual particle "sa" (and then, you know)
- **"じゃねえか"** - rough negative question (isn't it?!)
- **"なんてよっ"** - rough emphasis (things like... !)
- Logic: "You acted weird → we followed" - loyalty is action

**Friendship Philosophy:**
```
ロブ：テム。おれたちにかくれて旅に出ようったってそうはいかないぜ。
Rob: Tim, trying to go on a journey hiding from us won't work like that.

友達だったら楽しみと苦労はわかちあわなくっちゃな。
If we're friends, we have to share both joys and hardships.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"〜ようったって"** - rough conditional (even if you try to...)
- **"そうはいかないぜ"** - rough prohibition (won't work - masculine ぜ)
- **"わかちあわなくっちゃな"** - rough obligation (have to share - masculine な)
- Core value statement - friendship = shared experience
- "楽しみと苦労" - joys AND hardships (not just fun)

**Crisis Response:**
```
ロブ：だいじょうぶかっ？
Rob: Are you okay?!

モリスの悲鳴だっ！かんぱんの方から聞こえたぞっ！
That's Morris's scream! I heard it from the deck!

モリスはどうしたっ？！何があったんだっ！！
What happened to Morris?! What's going on?!

な何だってっ？！
Wh-What did you say?!

泣いてるヒマがあったら何かにつかまれっ！ふりおとされるなよっ！
If you have time to cry, grab onto something! Don't get thrown off!
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **Multiple small tsu っ** - emotional urgency (abrupt stops)
- **Double exclamation marks** - genuine alarm
- **Stutter "な何"** - shock breaking composure
- **Command forms**: "つかまれ" (grab), "ふりおとされるな" (don't fall)
- Practical emergency response - no philosophy, immediate action

**Phase 2 Summary**: Roughness serves loyalty. Rob's crude speech contains genuine care - follows friends into danger, articulates friendship value, responds to crisis with action commands. His bluntness is reliability.

---

**Phase 3: Vulnerability Exposed (Freejia - Chapters 13-15)**

**Emotional Register**: Confusion, identity loss, philosophical questioning  
**Voice Mode**: Broken version of self, still recognizable  
**Sentence Patterns**: Questions replace assertions

**Amnesia State:**
```
ロブ：自分がだれだかわからないってなんだか不思議だよ…
Rob: Not knowing who you are is kind of strange...

オレがだれだかわからないのにオレはなんでここにいるんだろ。
Even though I don't know who I am, why am I here?
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **Still uses "オレ"** - even with memory loss, core pronoun persists
- **"なんだか不思議だよ"** - soft wondering (strange somehow)
- **"なんで...んだろ"** - questioning self (why... I wonder)
- Existential questions unusual for Rob
- Shows identity crisis but VOICE remains

**Location Confusion:**
```
ロブ：ここはどこなんだろう…
Rob: Where is this...?

おれはサウスケープの町で育った
I was raised in the town of South Cape.

そしておやじは探険にいったままもどってこなかったんだっけ…
And my old man went on an expedition and never came back, right...?

自分の中でいちばん大きい存在がなくなってどうしていいかわからなかったなあ…
The biggest presence in my life disappeared, and I didn't know what to do...
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **Still "おれ"** and **"おやじ"** (rough "old man" for father)
- **"んだっけ"** - checking own memory (that's right, wasn't it?)
- **"なあ"** - reflective ending (shows processing)
- **"いちばん大きい存在"** - surprisingly emotional vocabulary
- Father's absence = defining wound (like Tim)

**Recovery:**
```
ロブ：あれ？おれ今まで何してたんだろう。
Rob: Huh? What was I doing until now?

それにみんなどうしたんだ？
And what's with everyone?

みんなに心配かけちゃったな。でも今度だれかが同じ立場になったらかんびょうするからさ。
I made everyone worry. But if someone ends up in the same situation next time, I'll take care of them.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"あれ？"** - mild confusion (huh?)
- **"何してたんだろう"** - wondering about self
- **"心配かけちゃった"** - casual regret (ちゃった = ended up doing)
- **"かんびょうする"** - will care for/nurse (reciprocity)
- **"からさ"** - rough reasoning particle
- Rob promises to return the care - friendship as exchange

**Phase 3 Summary**: Even broken, Rob's voice persists (おれ, おやじ, rough particles). But content reveals depth - father's loss shaped him, identity crisis prompts rare philosophy. Vulnerability doesn't feminize his speech, just expands emotional range.

---

**Phase 4: Romantic Awakening (Angel Village - Chapters 22-23)**

**Emotional Register**: Nervous confession, seeking advice, self-aware awkwardness  
**Voice Mode**: Rough guy admitting soft feelings  
**Sentence Patterns**: Hedging, embarrassment markers

**Approaching Tim:**
```
ロブ：テム。お前に一つそうだんがあるんだけどさ。
Rob: Tim, I have something to discuss with you.

言いにくいんだけどおれリリィのことを好きになっちまったみたいなんだ…
It's hard to say, but it seems I've fallen for Lillie...
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"そうだん"** - consultation (formal word, unusual for Rob)
- **"言いにくい"** - hard to say (admitting difficulty)
- **"好きになっちまった"** - fell for (ちまった = regrettable completion)
- **"みたい"** - seems like (hedging, uncertainty)
- Shows: Rob recognizes this feeling is outside his control, slightly regretful

**Describing Feelings:**
```
ロブ：夢だって彼女の夢ばっかりだし..気づくとリリィのことを目で追ってるんだよ。
Rob: Even my dreams are all about her... Before I know it, I'm following Lillie with my eyes.

おれらしくないと思ってるだろ？ ／ うんっ ／ そんなことないさ
You think it's not like me, right? / Yeah / No, that's not it.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"だって...ばっかり"** - even... nothing but (obsession)
- **"気づくと"** - before I know it (unconscious behavior)
- **"目で追ってる"** - following with eyes (visual stalking, admitted)
- **"おれらしくない"** - not like me (self-aware)
- **Gives Tim two options**, expects "yeah, weird" - shows insecurity

**Asking Advice:**
```
ロブ：それでさ。もうじきリリィの１５才のたんじょう日がくるらしいんだ。
Rob: So you see, Lillie's 15th birthday is coming up soon, apparently.

そのときプレゼントといっしょにおれの気持ちを話したいんだけどお前ならどれがいいとおもう？
At that time, I want to tell her my feelings along with a present, but which do you think would be good?

きれいな花たば ／ すてきなネックレス ／ あまーいキス
Beautiful bouquet / Nice necklace / Sweet kiss
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"それでさ"** - so you see (continuing explanation)
- **"らしい"** - apparently (hearsay marker)
- **"お前なら"** - if it were you (seeking friend's perspective)
- **"どれがいいとおもう"** - which do you think (genuine question)
- Rob researched birthday, planned confession, needs advice - shows effort

**Responses to Tim's Suggestions:**
```
やっぱりそうだよな。じゃあ花ことばで告白って意味のつぼみのバラを送ってみるかなあ。
(Bouquet) I thought so too. Then maybe I'll try sending a rosebud, which means confession in flower language.

なるほどなあ。じゃあきれいな石でもさがしてネックレスをつくってみるよ。
(Necklace) I see. Then I'll try searching for pretty stones and making a necklace.

いきなりだいたんすぎるような気もするけどお前がそういうならやってみるか…
(Kiss) It feels suddenly too bold, but if you say so, maybe I'll try it...
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"やっぱり"** - as expected (confirming own thought)
- **"花ことば"** - flower language (Rob knows this!)
- **"なるほどなあ"** - I see (considering)
- **"だいたんすぎる"** - too bold (self-awareness)
- Shows: Rob educated himself on romance (flower language), will take advice even if bold

**Gratitude:**
```
ロブ：そうだんにのってくれてサンキュ。
Rob: Thanks for hearing me out.

自分なりに考えてみるよ。もつべきものは友だちだなあ。
I'll think about it in my own way. You really need to have friends.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"サンキュ"** - thanks (English loanword, casual)
- **"自分なりに"** - in my own way (will personalize advice)
- **"もつべきもの"** - things you need to have (proverb-like)
- **"友だちだなあ"** - friends, huh (appreciative reflection)
- Maintains rough speech but sincere gratitude

**Later:**
```
ロブ：リリィは水上都市でたん生日を向えることになるんだよな…
Rob: Lillie will have her birthday in the water city...
```

**Linguistic Marker:**
- **"〜ことになる"** - it's been decided (planning)
- **"だよな"** - right? (confirming to self)
- Anticipation mixed with nervousness

**Phase 4 Summary**: Rob's roughness SLIGHTLY softens in romantic context - uses "そうだん" (consultation) instead of crude words, admits "言いにくい" (hard to say), hedges with "みたい" (seems like). BUT maintains "おれ", rough particles, casual forms. The content is vulnerable (dreams about her, follows with eyes), voice stays authentic. Shows WORKING-CLASS MASCULINITY can access tenderness without code-switching.

---

**Phase 5: Watermia Crisis (Chapter 24) - Dual Heartbreak**

**Emotional Register**: Compound grief - father broken, love rejected  
**Voice Mode**: Struggling to maintain composure  
**Sentence Patterns**: Short practical statements masking pain

**Father's Condition:**
```
ロブ：テムまってくれ。おれもいくよ。
Rob: Tim, wait. I'm coming too.

どうやら頭をやられちまっているみたいだ…
Looks like his head got messed up...

行方不明のおやじにやっと会えたと思ったらこれだもんな..
Just when I thought I could finally meet my missing father, it's like this...
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"まってくれ"** - wait (seeking companionship)
- **"頭をやられちまっている"** - head got messed up (crude medical diagnosis)
- **"やっと会えたと思ったら"** - just when I thought I could finally meet (cruel timing)
- **"これだもんな"** - it's like this (resigned acceptance)
- Shows: Parallel to Tim's father search, but worse - father alive but broken

**Maintaining Normalcy:**
```
ロブ：テムまってくれ。おれもいくよ。
Rob: Tim, wait. I'm coming too.

今日はこれからリリィのたんじょう日パーティーだしな。暗くなっちゃいられないさ。
Today we've got Lillie's birthday party from now. Can't afford to be gloomy.

さあ部屋へもどろうぜ。
Come on, let's go back to the room.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"だしな"** - after all/and besides (reasoning)
- **"暗くなっちゃいられない"** - can't afford to be gloomy (forcing positivity)
- **"さあ...ぜ"** - come on/let's (action-oriented)
- Compartmentalizes grief to function - birthday party must happen

**Birthday Party:**
```
ロブ：さあみんなそろったところでリリィのたんじょう日を祝うとしようか。
Rob: Well, now that everyone's here, let's celebrate Lillie's birthday.

リリィさあ。ちょっと話があるんだけどいいかな？
Lillie, I have something to talk about, okay?

先に外で待ってる。
I'll wait outside first.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"祝うとしようか"** - let's celebrate (formal start)
- **"ちょっと話が"** - a little talk (minimizing)
- **"いいかな"** - is it okay? (seeking permission, nervous)
- **"先に外で"** - outside first (setting private scene)
- Rob orchestrates despite personal pain - duty before feelings

**The Confession Scene:**
```
ロブ：そうだろ。おれも自分が自分じゃないみたいだよ。
Rob: Right? I feel like I'm not myself either.

これたんじょう日のプレゼント。いろいろ考えたんだけど気に入ってもらえるかな？
This is a birthday present. I thought about it a lot, but will you like it?

それからさ…プレゼントといっしょにどうしても伝えたい言葉があるんだ…
And also... there are words I absolutely want to tell you along with the present...

うん。早口言葉なんかよりずっとむずかしい言葉なんだけど…
Yeah. They're much harder words than tongue twisters...

リリィ…君のことが好きだ…
Lillie... I like you...

すぐ返事をしてくれなくてもいい…でもさ自分の気持ちを伝えておきたかったんだ…
You don't have to answer right away... But I wanted to tell you my feelings...

リリィ！まってくれっ！！
Lillie! Wait!!
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"自分が自分じゃない"** - not myself (unprecedented for Rob)
- **"気に入ってもらえるかな"** - will you like it (insecurity)
- **"どうしても伝えたい"** - absolutely want to tell (compulsion)
- **"早口言葉なんかより"** - harder than tongue twisters (humor masking nervousness)
- **"君のことが好きだ"** - I like you (using "君" not rough forms - gentle)
- **"伝えておきたかった"** - wanted to tell (regardless of outcome)
- **"まってくれっ"** - wait! (she runs away)
- Confession earnest, simple, direct - then rejection via flight

**Letter to Tim (afterward):**
```
ロブ：おれはちょっと万里の長城まで行ってくる。
Rob: I'm going to the Great Wall for a bit.

みんなにはないしょのつもりだったけどテムにだけは伝えておこうと思う…
I meant to keep it secret from everyone, but I thought I'd tell just you...

テムの荷物の中にこの手紙を入れとくけど気づいてくれたかな。テムはにぶいからな。
I'll put this letter in your luggage, but I wonder if you'll notice. Tim's pretty dense.

町の人の話からおやじの病気を直す方法がわかったんだ…万里の長城にその薬があるらしい。
From what the townspeople said, I learned how to cure my old man's illness... Apparently there's medicine at the Great Wall.

道のりは長いけどマラソンでもするつもりで行ってくるよ。心配しないでくれ。
The journey's long, but I'll go with the mindset of running a marathon. Don't worry.

追しん：あそうそう…リリィにふられちまったよ。
P.S.: Oh yeah... Lillie rejected me.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"ちょっと...行ってくる"** - going for a bit (minimizing danger)
- **"ないしょのつもり"** - meant to keep secret (independent action)
- **"テムにだけは"** - just you (special trust)
- **"にぶい"** - dense (affectionate teasing)
- **"マラソンでもする"** - like running marathon (making light of danger)
- **"心配しないでくれ"** - don't worry (protecting friends)
- **"あそうそう"** - oh yeah (treating heartbreak as afterthought)
- **"ふられちまった"** - got rejected (casual past, hiding pain)
- Shows: Rob escapes dual pain through action quest, hides emotional wound with casual tone

**Phase 5 Summary**: Watermia brings compound crisis - father's mental breakdown + romantic rejection. Rob responds in character: compartmentalizes pain, executes birthday duty, confesses with earnest simplicity ("君のことが好きだ"), faces rejection, then flees into dangerous quest. The letter reveals Rob's coping - makes light of both danger (marathon) and heartbreak (P.S. rejection). Rough voice maintained but content shows crushing double loss.

---

**Phase 6: Great Wall Reunion (Chapter 25) - Near-Death and Acceptance**

**Emotional Register**: Relief, joy, love accepted  
**Voice Mode**: Rough exuberance, unguarded happiness  
**Sentence Patterns**: Exclamations, celebratory roughness

Rob: I feel bad for making everyone worry.

でもおやじの病気を直す薬が手に入ったんだ。
But I got the medicine to cure my old man's illness.

あっその石は…
Oh, that stone...

テム…ちょっとの間だけリリィと２人にしてくれないか？
Tim... can you let me be alone with Lillie for just a bit?
```

- **"２人にしてくれないか"** - let us be alone (requesting privacy)
- Practical apology, focuses on success, needs private moment

```
ロブ：この石のおかげでおれは助かったんだよな…
Rob: Thanks to this stone, I was saved...

実はこれリリィのために作ったネックレスだったんだ…
Actually, this was a necklace I made for Lillie...

ネックレスの石がずいぶん少なくなっちゃったけど受けとってくれないか？
The stones in the necklace have decreased quite a bit, but will you accept it?
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"おかげで"** - thanks to (attribution)
- **"助かった"** - was saved (passive, humble)
- **"実は"** - actually (revelation)
- **"〜ために作った"** - made for (purpose)

- Shows: Gift was love insurance; used to survive; offers depleted version humbly

**Lillie's Kiss:**
```
ロブ：あっ…
Rob: Ah...
```

**Linguistic Marker:**
- Wordless (kiss renders rough Rob speechless)

**EXPLOSIVE JOY:**
```
ロブ：いやっほーっ！！こんな気分ってはじめてだっ！！
Rob: Yahoo!! This feeling is a first for me!!

学校が夏休みになったときの１００万倍くらいうれしいよっ！
I'm about 1,000,000 times happier than when school became summer vacation!

- **"うれしいよっ"** - happy! (rough exclamation)
- Shows: Rob expresses transcendent joy through CONCRETE COMPARISON (summer vacation) and NUMERIC HYPERBOLE (million times) - working-class poetics

**Phase 6 Summary**: Great Wall delivers resolution - medicine obtained, love accepted. Rob's response is pure exuberant rough joy. The necklace reveal shows his gift was protective talisman (worn as survival gear), now offered depleted but symbolic. Kiss silences him momentarily, then erupts into "いやっほー!" Victory cry uses rough forms but purest happiness. The "million times summer vacation" comparison shows Rob's mind - abstracts (love) explained through concrete experiences (school break).

---

**Phase 7: Mature Choice (Chapters 26-27) - Domestic Resolution**

**Emotional Register**: Settled confidence, bittersweet farewell  
**Voice Mode**: Young man making adult decisions  
**Sentence Patterns**: Explanatory, gentle but firm

**Staying Behind:**
```
ロブ：さっきおやじに薬をあたえてきたよ。
Rob: I gave my old man the medicine just now.

これからゆっくりと回復していくと思うんだ…
I think he'll recover slowly from here...

みんなには悪いけどおれはここに残るよ。あんなおやじを放っておくわけにいかないしな。
Sorry to everyone, but I'm staying here. I can't leave my old man like that.

それからさ…うーんなんかてれるなあ…
And also... hmm, this is embarrassing...

おれさ。リリィとつきあうことにしたんだ。
I've decided to go out with Lillie.

もちろんいいかげんな気持ちじゃないさ。ずっといっしょにいたいと思ってる。
Of course, my feelings aren't half-hearted. I want to be with her forever.

でリリィもいっしょに残りたいっていうからさ。
And Lillie said she wants to stay too.

みんなと旅ができて楽しかったよ。テムの旅の成功をいのってるよ。
It was fun traveling with everyone. I'm praying for Tim's journey to succeed.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"さっき...してきた"** - just now did (recent action, reporting)
- **"ゆっくりと回復"** - slowly recover (optimistic prognosis)
- **"悪いけど"** - sorry but (apologizing for choice)
- **"残る"** - stay/remain (active decision)
- **"放っておくわけにいかない"** - can't just leave (moral obligation)
- **"てれる"** - embarrassing (admitting shyness about romance)
- **"つきあう"** - go out/date (committed relationship)
- **"いいかげんな気持ちじゃない"** - not half-hearted (serious declaration)
- **"ずっといっしょに"** - forever together (permanent commitment)
- **"楽しかった"** - was fun (past tense - journey over for him)
- **"いのってる"** - praying for (blessing Tim's continuation)
- Shows: Rob explains rationally (father needs care, love is serious), admits embarrassment (still rough guy), blesses friends' journey

**Later Check-In:**
```
ロブ：おやじは日に日によくなっていくみたいだ…
Rob: My old man seems to be getting better day by day...

もうふつうにしゃべれるようになったしな。テムもはやくおやじに会えるといいよな。
He can speak normally now. I hope Tim can meet his old man soon too.

そうそう。たしかテムは赤い宝石を集めてたんだよな。
Oh yeah, I remember Tim was collecting red jewels, right?

おやじの持ち物の中から赤い宝石が見つかったんだよ。もっていきな。
A red jewel was found among my old man's belongings. Take it.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"日に日に"** - day by day (progressive improvement)
- **"みたい"** - seems like (cautious optimism)
- **"ふつうにしゃべれる"** - can speak normally (milestone)
- **"会えるといいよな"** - hope you can meet (empathy for Tim's quest)
- **"そうそう"** - oh yeah (remembering)
- **"たしか"** - if I remember (confirming memory)
- **"もっていきな"** - take it (rough imperative but generous)
- Shows: Rob tracks Tim's quest even while staying behind, helps with jewel, wishes Tim succeeds where Rob couldn't (Tim's father is lost, Rob's recovered)

**Final Line:**
```
テムもはやくおやじに会えるといいよな。
I hope Tim can meet his old man soon too.
```

**Linguistic Marker:**
- **"〜といいよな"** - hope... (empathy + masculine particle)
- TRAGIC IRONY: Rob doesn't know Tim's father is monster
- Rob's hope for Tim mirrors his own success (found broken father, healed him)
- But Tim's path is darker - no healing possible

**Phase 7 Summary**: Rob settles into adult choice with rough but mature voice. Explains decision rationally (father needs care), admits embarrassment about romance (still authentic guy), commits seriously (not half-hearted). Maintains rough pronouns (おやじ, おれ) and particles (な, さ, ぜ) but content is responsible adulthood. The final empathy for Tim's quest shows Rob doesn't see his choice as selfish - he hopes Tim gets what Rob got (father reunion). The tragic irony is Rob succeeds (cure, love, home) where Tim cannot.

---

## Overall Tone Evolution Pattern

**Consistency**: THREE elements NEVER change across all phases:
1. **First-person "おれ"** (ore) - rough masculine, from chapter 1 to 27
2. **Core particles**: じゃんか, だぜ, ぜ, な - rough masculine emphasis system
3. **Contractions**: ねえ (for ない), んだ (for のだ), ちゃった (for てしまった)

**Progression Through Content, Not Style**:
- **Chapters 1-3**: Casual roughness → "じゃんかっ" "だぜ" "わかんねーや"
- **Chapter 6**: Concerned friend → "うかない顔して" "なやみでもあるのか"
- **Chapters 10**: Loyal companion → "楽しみと苦労はわかちあわなくっちゃな"
- **Chapters 13-15**: Vulnerable amnesiac → "自分がだれだかわからない" "おやじは...もどってこなかった"
- **Chapters 16-21**: Observant companion → Morse code recognition, practical skills
- **Chapters 22-23**: Romantic confessor → "好きになっちまったみたいなんだ" "花ことば"
- **Chapter 24**: Dual crisis → Father broken, love rejected, quest begins
- **Chapter 25**: Near-death joy → "いやっほー！" "１００万倍うれしい"
- **Chapters 26-27**: Mature choice → "ずっといっしょにいたい" "楽しかったよ"

**The Arc**: Rough kid → Loyal friend → Broken victim → Romantic seeker → Near-death survivor → Committed partner → Domestic adult

**Translation Principle**: Rob's voice evolution comes through WHAT he talks about (games → friendship → love → family) and HOW he reacts (casual → protective → vulnerable → joyful → settled), NOT through changing his speech patterns. His particles, pronouns, contractions—all remain consistent. What changes is whether he's playing cards, facing Morris's death, confessing love, or choosing home. The linguistic tools stay the same; their application evolves.

---

## Core Linguistic Patterns - Detailed Analysis

### First-Person Pronoun: "おれ" (ore)

**Usage**: 100% consistent across all 92 lines  
**Meaning**: Rough masculine first-person pronoun  
**Social Register**: Working-class, casual, masculine but not aggressive

**Comparative Context**:
- **ぼく** (boku) - Soft masculine → Tim, Morris, Eric use this
- **おれ** (ore) - Rough masculine → Rob's exclusive choice
- **わたし** (watashi) - Neutral/polite → Adults, Karen uses this  
- **おいら** (oira) - Rural/rougher → Not in this game

**Translation Implication**: Rob is definitively working-class masculine but not thuggish. Not intellectual (boku), not polite, not refined. Natural rough kid who grows into rough young man. English needs to convey casual confidence without slang that ages poorly or seems aggressive.

### Sentence-Final Particles - The Rough Emphasis System

**1. じゃんか / じゃんかっ / じゃねえか**

**Function**: Rough assertion/complaint  
**Literal**: "Isn't it?" / "It is, right?!" / "It is, isn't it?!"  
**Emotional Load**: Confident assertion with challenge undertone

**Examples:**
```
なんだよテム。おそかったじゃんかっ。
What's up, Tim. You're late!
[Rough complaint - you ARE late, right?!]

じゅうぶん変な村じゃねえかっ。
Isn't it plenty weird?
[Rough rhetorical - it OBVIOUSLY is]

心配したじゃないっ！！
You had me worried!!
[Rough complaint, actually "didn't you make me worry?!"]
```

**Pattern**: Rob's signature particle. Appears in ~40% of his lines. Creates challenging, assertive tone even in friendly contexts. Much rougher than standard ない/ん forms.

**2. ぜ / だぜ**

**Function**: Rough masculine emphasis  
**Emotional Load**: "You know" / "I'm telling you" (masculine)

**Examples:**
```
もっとすごいことが起こったのかと思ったぜ。
I thought something even more amazing had happened, you know.

そうはいかないぜ。
That won't work, I'm telling you.

モリス。カード出したついでにもうひと勝負しようぜ。
Morris, since you've got cards out, let's have another match.
```

**Pattern**: Masculine certainty marker. Not aggressive, but definitively male speech. Volitional with ぜ (しようぜ - let's do it) is invitation but rough invitation.

**3. な / だな / よな**

**Function**: Seeking agreement (rougher than ね)  
**Emotional Load**: Masculine softening, confirmation seeking

**Examples:**
```
友達だったら楽しみと苦労はわかちあわなくっちゃな。
If we're friends, we have to share joys and hardships, right?

これだもんな。
It's like this, you know.

テムもはやくおやじに会えるといいよな。
I hope Tim can meet his old man soon too, yeah?
```

**Pattern**: Rough equivalent of feminine ね. Still seeking connection but maintains masculine edge. Much more common in later chapters when Rob becomes reflective.

**4. さ / からさ**

**Function**: Dismissive certainty or causal reasoning  
**Emotional Load**: "That's just how it is" / "Because, you know"

**Examples:**
```
でリリィもいっしょに残りたいっていうからさ。
And Lillie said she wants to stay too, so...

いいかげんな気持ちじゃないさ。
My feelings aren't half-hearted, that's for sure.

心配しないでくれ。
Don't worry. (followed by reasoning)
```

**Pattern**: Used for explanations and certainties. "からさ" is rough causal connector. "〜ないさ" is rough dismissal of worry.

### Rough Contractions and Forms

**Standard → Rob's Contraction:**

- **ない → ねえ**
  - わからない → わかんねーや
  - じゃない → じゃねえか

- **のだ → んだ**
  - 勝負をしているのだ → 勝負をしてるんだ
  - 会えたのだ → 会えたんだ

- **てしまった → ちゃった / ちまった**
  - 好きになってしまった → 好きになっちまった
  - 心配かけてしまった → 心配かけちゃった
  - ふられてしまった → ふられちまった

- **〜ておく → とく**
  - 入れておく → 入れとく

**Pattern**: Rob consistently uses maximally contracted forms. Not sloppy - this is authentic working-class Japanese. Shows social class, regional influence, masculine casual register.

### Vocabulary Patterns

**Family Terms:**
- **"おやじ"** (oyaji) - old man / pops (for father)
  - NOT "父さん" (tou-san) like Tim
  - NOT "お父さん" (otou-san) polite
  - Rough but affectionate

**Intensity Words:**
- **"わがまま"** - selfish (about Karen)
- **"いきなり"** - suddenly/all of a sudden  
- **"ものすごく"** - incredibly/really  
- **"じゅうぶん"** - plenty/enough (with sarcasm)

**Casual Address:**
- **"お前"** (omae) - you (rough, for friends)
- **"君"** (kimi) - you (softer, only for Lillie in confession)
- **"テム"** / **"モリス"** / **"エリック"** - plain names, no honorifics

**Emotional Vocabulary:**
- **"心配"** (shinpai) - worry (frequent)
- **"楽しい"** (tanoshii) - fun/enjoyable
- **"うれしい"** (ureshii) - happy
- **"てれる"** (tereru) - embarrassed (romance context)

**Pattern**: Direct emotional vocabulary without euphemism. When worried, says worried. When happy, says happy. Rough forms around tender content - signature move.

---

## Relationship Dynamics - How Rob Speaks to Others

### To Tim (Closest Friend)

**Role**: Equal, loyal companion, confidant  
**Voice**: Rough casual with trust

**Early:**
```
なんだよテム。おそかったじゃんかっ。
What's up, Tim? You're late!

[Casual greeting, rough complaint - comfortable]
```

**Mid:**
```
友達だったら楽しみと苦労はわかちあわなくっちゃな。
If we're friends, we have to share joys and hardships.

[Values articulation, rough particle but sincere]
```

**Late:**
```
テムに一つそうだんがあるんだけどさ。
I have something to discuss with you, Tim.

[Vulnerability, seeking advice about Lillie]

みんなと旅ができて楽しかったよ。テムの旅の成功をいのってるよ。
It was fun traveling with everyone. I'm praying for Tim's journey to succeed.

[Blessing friend's continuation while staying behind]
```

**Pattern Shift**: Casual → Loyal → Vulnerable → Supportive. Rob trusts Tim enough to confess romantic feelings and ask advice. The "おれ" and rough particles persist but content shows deepening emotional bond.

### To Morris (Intellectual Gap)

**Role**: Friend but acknowledges gap  
**Voice**: Respectful rough, self-aware

```
ロブ：学者モリスの言うことはむずかしくてオレにはよくわかんねーや。
Rob: Scholar Morris says things that are difficult; I don't really get it.

モリス。カード出したついでにもうひと勝負しようぜ。
Morris, since you've got cards out, let's have another match.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"学者モリス"** - Scholar Morris (acknowledging role)
- **"わかんねーや"** - don't get it (admitting limits without shame)
- **"しようぜ"** - let's play (returning to common ground - cards)

**Pattern**: Rob doesn't pretend to match Morris's intellect. Admits "I don't get it" casually, then suggests activity he CAN do (cards). Shows secure identity - not threatened by friend's smarts.

### To Karen (Class Friction)

**Role**: Dismissive, critical  
**Voice**: Blunt class awareness

**Chapter 2:**
```
ロブ：そんなにあわてて飛びこんでくるからもっとすごいことが起こったのかと思ったぜ。
Rob: You rushed in so frantically, I thought something even more amazing had happened.

それに王女ってあのわがまま娘のカレンだろ。あんなヤツのどこがいいんだっ？
Besides, the princess is that selfish girl Karen, right? What's good about someone like her?
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"わがまま娘"** - selfish girl (blunt description)
- **"あんなヤツ"** - someone like that (dismissive, crude)
- **"どこがいいんだっ"** - what's good about (rhetorical challenge)

**Pattern**: No deference to royalty. Sees Karen as spoiled, expresses it directly. Class resentment underneath - "わがまま" (selfish) is Rob's read on princess behavior.

### To Eric (Moderate Friend)

**Limited interaction in dialogue data**, but presumably similar to Tim - rough casual friendship.

### To Lillie (Romantic Evolution)

**Early (Companion)**: No specific lines, presumably casual like with others

**Mid (Awakening - Chapter 22)**:
```
言いにくいんだけどおれリリィのことを好きになっちまったみたいなんだ…
It's hard to say, but it seems I've fallen for Lillie...

夢だって彼女の夢ばっかりだし..気づくとリリィのことを目で追ってるんだよ。
Even my dreams are all about her... Before I know it, I'm following Lillie with my eyes.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **Still "おれ"** (doesn't soften to ぼく)
- **"好きになっちまった"** - fell for (ちまった = regrettable/uncontrollable)
- **"みたい"** - seems like (hedging, uncertainty)
- Vulnerable content, rough form - authentic combination

**Confession (Chapter 24)**:
```
リリィ…君のことが好きだ…
Lillie... I like you...

すぐ返事をしてくれなくてもいい…でもさ自分の気持ちを伝えておきたかったんだ…
You don't have to answer right away... But I wanted to tell you my feelings...
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **"君"** (kimi) - softer "you" (NOT rough "お前")
- **"好きだ"** - plain form, direct (I like you)
- **Ellipses** - weight, hesitation
- **"伝えておきたかった"** - wanted to tell (regardless of outcome)

**Post-Acceptance (Chapter 25-27)**:
```
おれさ。リリィとつきあうことにしたんだ。
I've decided to go out with Lillie.

もちろんいいかげんな気持ちじゃないさ。ずっといっしょにいたいと思ってる。
Of course, my feelings aren't half-hearted. I want to be with her forever.
```

**Linguistic Markers:**
- **Returns to rough "さ"** particles
- **"つきあう"** - go out/date (committed relationship)
- **"いいかげんじゃない"** - not half-hearted (serious assertion)
- **"ずっといっしょに"** - forever together (permanent commitment)

**Pattern Evolution**: Rob's CONTENT toward Lillie evolves (casual → attracted → confessor → committed) but VOICE stays rough. ONLY concession is using "君" (kimi) instead of "お前" (omae) during confession - this is Rob being as gentle as he knows how. Otherwise maintains おれ, rough particles, contractions. Shows working-class masculinity doesn't code-switch for romance - authentic self is the offering.

## Thematic Threads in Rob's Voice

### Theme 1: Working-Class Masculinity Finding Emotional Depth

**Core Pattern**: Rough speech containing tender content

**Early Establishment:**
```
ロブ：学者モリスの言うことはむずかしくてオレにはよくわかんねーや。
Rob: Scholar Morris says things that are difficult; I don't really get it.
```

Shows: Rob comfortable with intellectual limits. No shame in not understanding. Secure in different kind of intelligence.

**Friendship Values:**
```
ロブ：友達だったら楽しみと苦労はわかちあわなくっちゃな。
Rob: If we're friends, we have to share both joys and hardships.
```

Shows: Rob can articulate VALUES despite rough form. Working-class ethics - loyalty is action, friendship is shared experience.

**Romantic Vulnerability:**
```
ロブ：言いにくいんだけどおれリリィのことを好きになっちまったみたいなんだ…
Rob: It's hard to say, but it seems I've fallen for Lillie...

夢だって彼女の夢ばっかりだし..気づくとリリィのことを目で追ってるんだよ。
Even my dreams are all about her... Before I know it, I'm following Lillie with my eyes.
```

Shows: Rob admits HELPLESSNESS in love ("ちまった" = happened against will). Describes obsession (dreams, following with eyes) using rough forms. Emotional depth THROUGH rough speech, not despite it.

**Pattern**: Rob's arc proves working-class speech can contain full emotional range. He doesn't code-switch to "proper" Japanese for serious moments - his authentic voice IS the emotional vehicle.

**Translation Principle**: Don't "clean up" Rob's speech in tender moments. The roughness IS the authenticity. "おれリリィのことを好きになっちまった" shouldn't become "I have developed feelings for Lillie" - it's "I fell for Lillie" with ROUGH form intact.

### Theme 2: Father-Son Bond as Parallel to Tim

**Rob's Father Arc:**

**Missing Father:**
```
ロブ：そしておやじは探険にいったままもどってこなかったんだっけ…
Rob: And my old man went on an expedition and never came back, right...?

自分の中でいちばん大きい存在がなくなってどうしていいかわからなかったなあ…
The biggest presence in my life disappeared, and I didn't know what to do...
```

**Found Broken:**
```
ロブ：どうやら頭をやられちまっているみたいだ…
Rob: Looks like his head got messed up...

行方不明のおやじにやっと会えたと思ったらこれだもんな..
Just when I thought I could finally meet my missing father, it's like this...
```

**Quest for Cure:**
```
ロブ：町の人の話からおやじの病気を直す方法がわかったんだ…万里の長城にその薬があるらしい。
Rob: From what the townspeople said, I learned how to cure my old man's illness... Apparently there's medicine at the Great Wall.
```

**Success:**
```
ロブ：でもおやじの病気を直す薬が手に入ったんだ。
Rob: But I got the medicine to cure my old man's illness.

おやじは日に日によくなっていくみたいだ…もうふつうにしゃべれるようになったしな。
My old man seems to be getting better day by day... He can speak normally now.
```

**Parallel to Tim:**
- Both: Father disappeared on expedition
- Both: Father's absence = defining wound ("いちばん大きい存在")
- Both: Search for father drives journey
- **Rob**: Finds father ALIVE but broken → CAN CURE → SUCCESS
- **Tim**: Finds father TRANSFORMED to monster → CANNOT CURE → TRAGEDY

**Significance**: Rob gets the ending Tim cannot have. Rob's father broken but curable; Tim's father lost to cosmic horror. This creates THEMATIC CONTRAST:
- Rob's arc = HOPE (domestic happiness possible)
- Tim's arc = SACRIFICE (cosmic duty requires personal loss)

Rob staying in Watermia isn't giving up - it's SUCCEEDING at family restoration while Tim must continue cosmic quest.

**Linguistic Note**: Rob calls father "おやじ" (rough but affectionate) vs. Tim's "父さん" (standard affectionate). Shows class difference even in family terms.

### Theme 3: Loyalty as Action, Not Words

**Pattern**: Rob demonstrates friendship through DOING, not eloquent speech

**Following Tim:**
```
ロブ：お前の様子が変だから３人でこっそり後をつけたんだ。
Rob: You were acting weird, so the three of us secretly followed you.

そしたら変な村にたどりついてさ…
Then we arrived at a weird village...
```

Shows: Logic is simple - friend acting weird → follow him. No debate, just action.

**Articulating Values:**
```
ロブ：友達だったら楽しみと苦労はわかちあわなくっちゃな。
Rob: If we're friends, we have to share both joys and hardships.
```

Shows: Rob CAN articulate philosophy, but only when necessary. Otherwise acts without explanation.

**Crisis Response:**
```
ロブ：だいじょうぶかっ？
Rob: Are you okay?!

モリスの悲鳴だっ！かんぱんの方から聞こえたぞっ！
That's Morris's scream! I heard it from the deck!

泣いてるヒマがあったら何かにつかまれっ！ふりおとされるなよっ！
If you have time to cry, grab onto something! Don't get thrown off!
```

Shows: Emergency = commands, not comfort. "Grab something!" is how Rob expresses care.

**Solo Quest:**
```
ロブ：町の人の話からおやじの病気を直す方法がわかったんだ…万里の長城にその薬があるらしい。
Rob: From what the townspeople said, I learned how to cure my old man's illness... Apparently there's medicine at the Great Wall.

道のりは長いけどマラソンでもするつもりで行ってくるよ。心配しないでくれ。
The journey's long, but I'll go with the mindset of running a marathon. Don't worry.
```

Shows: Doesn't ask for help. Researches (talks to townspeople), makes plan (Great Wall), minimizes danger (like a marathon), goes alone. ACTION over words.

**Pattern**: Rob's love language is ACTS OF SERVICE. He helps through doing, not discussing. Translation should preserve this - don't make him more verbally expressive than he is.

### Theme 4: Concrete Thinking Over Abstract

**Pattern**: Rob explains emotions through PHYSICAL COMPARISONS

**Joy Expression:**
```
ロブ：いやっほーっ！！こんな気分ってはじめてだっ！！
Rob: Yahoo!! This feeling is a first for me!!

学校が夏休みになったときの１００万倍くらいうれしいよっ！
I'm about 1,000,000 times happier than when school became summer vacation!
```

**Analysis**:
- Abstract feeling (love, acceptance) → Concrete comparison (summer vacation)
- Numeric hyperbole (1,000,000 times)
- Relatable child joy as measuring stick
- Shows: Rob's mind works through TANGIBLE EXPERIENCES, not abstracts

**Romantic Description:**
```
ロブ：夢だって彼女の夢ばっかりだし..気づくとリリィのことを目で追ってるんだよ。
Rob: Even my dreams are all about her... Before I know it, I'm following Lillie with my eyes.
```

**Analysis**:
- Describes love through PHYSICAL BEHAVIORS (dreaming, visual tracking)
- "気づくと" (before I know it) = unconscious body action
- Doesn't say "I feel deeply" - says "I watch her without realizing"
- Shows: Rob understands emotion through body/action

**Quest Metaphor:**
```
ロブ：道のりは長いけどマラソンでもするつもりで行ってくるよ。
Rob: The journey's long, but I'll go with the mindset of running a marathon.
```

**Analysis**:
- Dangerous quest → Marathon (athletic event)
- Makes light through sports comparison
- Physical activity as mental frame
- Shows: Rob conceptualizes challenge through BODILY EXPERIENCE

**Pattern**: Working-class poetics - emotions explained through:
1. Physical sensations
2. Concrete experiences
3. Numeric hyperbole
4. Athletic/bodily metaphors

**Translation Principle**: Preserve Rob's concrete language. Don't abstract it ("I'm ecstatic" loses "million times summer vacation"). His working-class mind is PHYSICAL and SPECIFIC.

### Theme 5: Choice Between Heroism and Ordinary Happiness

**The Decision:**
```
ロブ：みんなには悪いけどおれはここに残るよ。あんなおやじを放っておくわけにいかないしな。
Rob: Sorry to everyone, but I'm staying here. I can't leave my old man like that.

それからさ…うーんなんかてれるなあ…おれさ。リリィとつきあうことにしたんだ。
And also... hmm, this is embarrassing... I've decided to go out with Lillie.

もちろんいいかげんな気持ちじゃないさ。ずっといっしょにいたいと思ってる。
Of course, my feelings aren't half-hearted. I want to be with her forever.

みんなと旅ができて楽しかったよ。テムの旅の成功をいのってるよ。
It was fun traveling with everyone. I'm praying for Tim's journey to succeed.
```

**Analysis**:
- TWO REASONS: Father needs care + Love with Lillie
- Apologizes ("悪いけど") but doesn't waver
- Admits embarrassment about romance ("てれる") - still rough guy
- Commits seriously ("いいかげんじゃない" "ずっといっしょに")
- Blesses Tim's continuation ("いのってる")
- Past tense "楽しかった" (was fun) - journey OVER for Rob

**Thematic Significance**:
- Tim = COSMIC PATH (hero, sacrifice, duty)
- Rob = DOMESTIC PATH (family, love, home)
- BOTH VALID
- Rob doesn't fail Tim - he succeeds at DIFFERENT GOALS
- Game presents TWO PATHS to meaning:
  1. Extraordinary heroism (Tim)
  2. Ordinary happiness (Rob)

**Rob's Success**:
- Found missing father ✓
- Cured father's illness ✓
- Fell in love ✓
- Love reciprocated ✓
- Established home ✓

**Tim's Success**:
- Cosmic duty fulfilled ✓
- But: Father lost to monster ✗
- Love with Karen uncertain ✗
- Cannot have ordinary life ✗

**Pattern**: Rob WINS at domestic goals. Stays behind not from weakness but from COMPLETION. His quest done, Tim's continues.

**Translation Principle**: Don't make Rob's choice sound like quitting. It's CHOOSING love/family over continued adventure. The blessing ("いのってる") shows he wants Tim to succeed - different paths, mutual respect.

- Empathy for Tim's quest
- Two valid paths (heroism vs. happiness)

## Translation Guidelines

### Register and Formality

**Target**: Natural **contemporary working-class teen boy** speech, **American context**, rough but not aggressive

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Pretentious: "I must confess my affections"
- ❌ Thuggish: "Yo, shorty, you late as hell"
- ❌ Valley: "Like, whatever, dude"
- ❌ Polished: "I've been concerned about you"

**Embrace**:
- ✅ Direct: "You're late!" "What's up?" "Let's go"
- ✅ Contracted: "Don't get it" "Can't leave" "Won't work"
- ✅ Rough but clear: "You're late, man!" "That won't work"
- ✅ Working-class warmth: "Old man" (for father), "you know" (for ぜ/な)

**Example Translations:**

❌ Too polished: "Morris articulates concepts beyond my comprehension."  
✅ Just right: "Morris says stuff I don't really get."

❌ Too rough: "Ain't no way that princess chick is worth it."  
✅ Just right: "That princess is just a selfish girl. What's good about someone like her?"

### Particle Rendering

**じゃんか / じゃねえか:**
- Function: Rough assertion/complaint
- **Options**: 
  - "You're late!" (implied complaint)
  - "You're late, man!" (friendly rough)
  - "You ARE late!" (emphasis on truth)
- **Avoid**: "aren't you?" (too proper)

**だぜ / ぜ:**
- Function: Rough masculine "you know" / "I'm telling you"
- **Options**:
  - "...you know" / "...I'm saying"
  - Implied through confident tone
- **Avoid**: Literal "ze" sounds silly

**な / よな:**
- Function: Rough seeking agreement
- **Options**:
  - "...right?" / "...yeah?"
  - "...you know?"
- **Avoid**: "...ne?" (preserves Japanese)

**からさ / さ:**
- Function: Causal / dismissive
- **Options**:
  - "...so..." / "...that's why..."
  - "That's just how it is"
- **Avoid**: Overly formal "therefore"

### Handling Emotional Moments

**Rough Speech in Tender Context - PRESERVE THE ROUGHNESS**

**Confession:**
```
Japanese: リリィ…君のことが好きだ…
BAD: "Lillie, I have feelings for you."
GOOD: "Lillie... I like you..."
```
- Keep simple, direct
- "Like" not "have feelings" (too formal)
- Ellipses for weight

**Joy:**
```
Japanese: いやっほーっ！！こんな気分ってはじめてだっ！！学校が夏休みになったときの１００万倍くらいうれしいよっ！
BAD: "I'm ecstatic! This is unprecedented happiness!"
GOOD: "Yahoo!! This feeling is a first for me!! I'm like a million times happier than when school let out for summer!"
```
- Keep "yahoo" or similar (rough exclamation)
- Preserve concrete comparison (summer vacation)
- Keep hyperbole (million times)

**Vulnerability:**
```
Japanese: 言いにくいんだけどおれリリィのことを好きになっちまったみたいなんだ…
BAD: "It's difficult to articulate, but I may have developed romantic feelings for Lillie."
GOOD: "It's hard to say, but... I think I've fallen for Lillie."
```
- "Hard to say" not "difficult to articulate"
- "Fallen for" captures ちまった (happened against will)
- Keep rough "I think" for "みたい" hedging

### Contractions and Casual Forms

**Standard English → Rob's Contraction:**

- "do not" → "don't"
- "cannot" → "can't"  
- "will not" → "won't"
- "I am" → "I'm" (but sometimes "I" for emphasis)
- "going to" → "gonna" (sparingly, when very casual)

**But AVOID over-contracting:**
- ❌ "ain't" (too dialectal)
- ❌ "wanna" "gotta" (unless very informal moment)
- ❌ "dunno" (unless specifically "don't know" moment)

**Key Principle**: Rob's speech is CLEAR rough, not MUDDY rough. Contractions yes, but comprehensible.

### Family and Social Terms

**Father:**
- "おやじ" → "old man" or "my old man" (working-class affectionate)
- NOT "father" (too formal)
- NOT "dad" (Rob's rougher than that)

**Friends:**
- "お前" → "you" (context shows roughness)
- OR "man" / "dude" (sparingly, if fits)
- Names: "Tim" "Morris" "Eric" (no honorifics)

**Lillie (Special):**
- Usually "リリィ" → "Lillie" (direct)
- Confession: "君" → still "you" (but context is gentle)

**Karen:**
- "あんなヤツ" → "someone like her" / "a girl like that"
- "わがまま娘" → "selfish girl" / "that spoiled girl"

## Critical Dos and Don'ts

### DO:
✅ Preserve Rob's roughness even in tender moments  
✅ Use contractions consistently  
✅ Keep concrete comparisons (summer vacation for joy)  
✅ Maintain "old man" for おやじ  
✅ Show emotion through ACTIONS and PHYSICAL descriptions  
✅ Let Rob be inarticulate when appropriate ("うーん" / "hmm")  
✅ Preserve his working-class intelligence (street smart, not book smart)  
✅ Keep self-awareness about limits ("don't get it" about Morris)

### DON'T:
❌ Polish his speech for emotional moments  
❌ Make him eloquent about feelings (he's direct, not poetic)  
❌ Remove class markers  
❌ Turn "おれ" into "I" without roughness in voice  
❌ Make his joy abstract (preserve "million times summer vacation")  
❌ Add aggression not in Japanese (rough ≠ angry)  
❌ Make his choice to stay sound like quitting  
❌ Over-dialectalize (avoid "ain't" "y'all" etc.)

## Conclusion: Rob's Voice as Authentic Working-Class Heart

Rob's character arc spans:
- 92 dialogue entries
- 27 chapters
- Complete journey: rough kid → loyal friend → vulnerable victim → romantic confessor → near-death survivor → domestic adult

His voice reflects:
- **Working-Class Masculinity**: Rough speech containing tender content
- **Loyalty as Action**: Friendship through doing, not eloquent words
- **Concrete Thinking**: Emotions explained through physical experiences
- **Father-Son Bond**: Parallel to Tim but different outcome (cure vs. loss)
- **Two Paths**: Chooses ordinary happiness (family + love) over extraordinary adventure

**Core Consistency:** "おれ" + rough particles (じゃんか, だぜ, な) + contractions (ねえ, んだ, ちまった) - unchanged through all emotional states

**For Translators**: Rob's voice requires maintaining roughness THROUGH emotional evolution, not despite it. His working-class speech is the vehicle for full emotional range. Don't clean up for romance, don't formalize for serious moments, don't polish for maturity. The authentic rough voice IS the character - strip it and you lose Rob entirely.

**For Editors**: Rob proves working-class speech can contain philosophy ("share joys and hardships"), vulnerable confession ("fallen for Lillie"), and mature commitment ("want to be together forever") without code-switching to "proper" forms. The roughness isn't limitation - it's authenticity.

**For AI Assistants**: Rob's baseline is rough directness with emotional depth underneath. His pattern: observe → act → (rarely) explain. Shows love through actions (making necklace, solo quest for cure), expresses joy through concrete comparisons (million times summer vacation), commits seriously while maintaining rough forms ("いいかげんな気持ちじゃないさ"). The "おれ" and particles never soften - this is strength, not stubbornness. He's the working-class heart of the friend group who gets his happy ending - family restored, love requited, home found - while Tim continues cosmic quest. Different paths, equal validity.
