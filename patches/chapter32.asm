;Explorer: Traps are scattered through the ruins to prevent people from entering.

;There's a story that says this room has a mechanism that reacts to sound... Don't make any loud noises, even by mistake.

;A voice echoes in your head.

;I have been waiting all of this time for this moment to come.

;Make no mistake. I am Shadow; the ultimate warrior, produced by the comet's light.

;My body is formless... You may think of it as what a human becomes when only their consciousness evolves.

;The comet that is now nearing the Earth is also a formless body of pure consciousness.

;Only my body can oppose the destruction-bringing comet.

;Well, you should close your eyes...

;I am the fountainhead of life, Gaia. Thy Power of Darkness has grown even stronger since thou wert at the temple of Angkor Wat.

;Shouldst thou stand in front of the statue to the right, thou canst change into Shadow, a more powerful Warrior of Darkness.

;Thus, I want to bestow an item upon thee.

;Got the Ball of Aura!

;The Ball of Aura is Shadow's heart. Shadow's body changes to be like water if they raise it.

;The Pyramid as it is now known, the Pyramid as seen on the surface, is in reality only one part of the whole. Most of it is sleeping underground.

;Well, thou shouldst transform into Shadow and head underground.

;Power of Darkness / Shadow's status / An explanation of the selected Power of Darkness will be displayed with the confirm button.

;Ball of Aura / If used while in the form of Shadow, the Warrior of Darkness, transforms your body to liquid.

;The Pyramid's entrance is vaguely reflected in the blue light... / Leave it be / Jump inside

;An engraved slate is stored in the wall. Is this the form of writing called "hieroglyph" that I heard of in Dao..?

;You removed the engraved slate and took it with you.

;Got the engraved hieroglyphic slate!

;Found a Red Jewel! However, your inventory was full.

;Hieroglyph / A engraved slate that bears an ancient Egyptian character.

;There's no place to insert the hieroglyph slate...

;Be a good boy and stand to the left..!!

;I said, stand to the left..!!

;There's no tile inserted now…

;Alright, that's good. Stay still just like that...!!

;Black Panther: You, sir, have been shown me everything you've done from start to finish.

;I hear that you have biotechnology from millennia ago that uses the light of the comet... You're something unbelievable, aren't you?

;You could get whatever you wanted if you had that shapeshifting power. Humans would kneel before you.

;Even if King Edward started to act out of desperation, it's not without reason...

;Karen: Father's behind this?!

;Black Panther: That's right! It's the king behind it in the end.

;He'll use any means necessary to gain power.

;Maybe he's even crueler than an assassin like me. Mweheheh.

;Karen: Stop it...! Don't say that kind of thing!!

;Black Panther: Well, whatever he does, I'm fine as long as I get paid.

;Now, if you'll come to Edward Castle with me.

;A voice whispers in Tim's head...

;Tim... Play the flute... Tim...

;Black Panther: If you go any further than that, this knife here is going to move...

;You held up the Ball of Aura but nothing happened...

;Quietly began playing melody learned from Laura.

;Black Panther: Uwhaaaaaaaagh!!

;Karen... Kare...

;Karen: Tim…

;Why can't everyone help but kill each other..?

;I... Still...

;Karen: I'm sorry... I lost my composure...

;I'm persevering so that you can the world, you know?

;Although Dad must have been searching for me when I started out on this journey...

;Somehow things have become terrible, haven't they...

;But, as for me, I'm not regretting coming along on this journey.

;Well, I'll see you later. Search for the 5th Mystery Doll…

;The song that you played just now turned out to be Black Panther's funeral dirge, didn't it...

;There are 6 indentations that seem like tiles could fit in.

;Where will you insert it? / 1st from the left / 2nd from the left / 3rd from the left / 4th from the left / 5th from the left / 6th from the left

;Inserted the hieroglyph slate into the indentation!

;Nothing happened... Could you have made a mistake with the arrangement? Try doing it once more from the beginning.

;I'm now looking after 42 Red Jewels from you.

;Wow... Some kind of sound came from just past the entrance!

;The mummified queen of the Pyramid is projected in the blue light.. / Leave it alone / Jump inside

;After you defeated the Pyramid's guardian god, you found a Mystery Doll from their corpse!!

;You could hear a voice from your flute! It was the same voice that you heard at Edward Castle's prison...

;Flute: You're managed to stay strong, haven't you, Tim.

;Tim: Dad?!

;I'm now at the Tower of Babel. Please take the five Mystery Dolls and come here.

;The puppets that you had collected until now are holding the key to the fate of mankind; whether humanity lives or dies.

;The comet is approaching... Tim... Hurry, hurr. y..

;The flute's voice ultimately faded away until it could no long be heard...

;Karen: It seems like something terrible is happening at a place we don't know, huh…

;Tim: What do we do…? Even if he suddenly told us to come to the Tower of Babel, going out to a little island on the deep blue sea…

;Karen: Hey, you know, Neil says that made an aeroplane again.

;It seems that the aeroplane is being brought to the desert town. First of all, let's try returning there.

;Neil: Is that so... I guess that you're ultimately going no matter what?

;If you had said that from a long time ago, I'd say that you were just a jerk that doesn't listen.

;I understand. Well, I'll send Karen and Eric to South Cape after I send you to the Tower of Babel.

;We probably won't fall this time, so please relax.
