;Lillie: Here is the entrance of the Incan ruins.
;Those that are called the "Inca" were also widespread, right? They say that the mystery of Inca legend is hidden here.
;I had heard this kind of story from the elder when I was little, but...
;It seems that at one time, when the Inca were raided, they were going to abandon their motherland and search for new land.
;The Incan people were said to have boarded a giant ship built with the most valuable golden craftwork, which stole the invaders' glance.
;But, you know, they say that there is no remaining record of that boat's departure...
;That ship is probably the gold ship sleeping to the Inca.
;I imagine that the elder hasn't told this legend to anyone outside the Itory clan until now.
;It seems like the elder is doing something to Tim...
