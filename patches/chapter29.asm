;Aboriginals' village

;Karen: It can get amazingly hot around the tropics, huh...

;Eric: I'm even seeing the world as warped; everything looks hazy...

;Tim: I guess it can't be helped. Today, should we stay in this village?

;It still isn't significantly weathered... It seems like a recently skeletonized corpse.

;Karen: It's a little ominous, isn't it…? There isn't a single person at all but skeletons are lying around...

;Not to take away from that; shall we enter a house and take a look inside?

;Statues of girls are standing quietly.

;Karen: No one's here, huh... I wonder if it's an abandoned village...?

;Eric: It's just right for us, isn't it? We can rest as much as we like.

;Eric: I'm already exhausted. I don't think I'll get up for a hundred hours.

;Squee squee...

;Karen: Let's try to rest for today.

;We were tired from the journey, so the party fell into a deep sleep...

;From there, after a while...

;Tim: Mrrrm... Peggy...? Let me sleep a little more...

;Karen: Ugh... Wait a second, Tim... Don't touch me in weird places...

;Karen: Huh...! Who...? Who are you...?!

;It seemed like they could have been a cannibal tribe...

;Karen: Look. Those children. They've become all skin and bones...

;Tim: That's right... Isn't that what the slave boy in the Capital of Flowers was saying?

;In his hometown, there's a food shortage...

;Karen: I guess those mysterious bones that were scattered around were the remains of people who they had eaten, aren't they?

;Eric: Waah. They're going to eat usss...!

;Karen: Peggy... Making sad-looking eyes like that...

;Could it be that you're parting with everyone soon...?

;Karen: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeek...!! Peggy...! Peggyyy...!!

;Tim: Peggy... Why…?

;Eric: Waah... Peggy... You snuck ahead and died before us...

;Karen: Peggy... Sob.. Sob…

;Inside our heads, a voice that I was familiar with before began to speak to us.

;Everyone, please listen. Peggy became food for the villagers by her own personal decision.

;One piglet acted to save several villagers.

;Tim: Could you be my mom...?

;Tim... And everyone that's come this far...

;Darkness is approaching the world. Now it's your turn to put your powers together and save this planet.

;So Tim. Please collect the Mystery Dolls and head to the Tower of Babel.

;The man is staring motionlessly into your eyes...

;Stare back? / Yes / No

;It seems like man is staring at himself within your eyes…

;You don't understand each other's language, but you felt like it seemed like the buds of understanding had sprouted.

;The man's face seems lonely...

;The man holds out a trembling hand...

;Grasp his hand in return? / Yes / No

;You can't understand each other, but you felt that it seemed like something had been communicated.

;The man holds out a tiny piece of food...

;Try to eat it? / Yes / No

;It seemed like it was made of bugs and pressed into the shape of a dumpling...

;It made you nauseated, but you felt that it seemed like something had been communicated.

;The man seemed to make a sad-looking face...

;The boy points to the northeast...

;Try showing him your map? / Yes / No

;You don't understand his language, but the boy probably wants to go to this Buddhist temple...

;The boy made a lonely-seeming face...

;The boy pulls on your sleeve. He probably wants to take you somewhere.

;Go along? / Yes / No

;The boy smiled and beckoned with his hand.

;The boy is facing the skeleton with tears welling in his eyes...

;Was this skeleton a blood relative? Or could they have been a friend?

;The man made a sad-looking face...

;Squee squee...

;You can't ever hear the voice which made that sound again...

;A savoury scent is floating from Peggy.

;Eric: When we found this so-called cannibal tribe, I had thought they must be terrifying people to eat other humans.

;Even though they were of the same tribe, they had to eat their friends in order to survive... I guess that humans are animals after all...

;Karen: How could she leap into the fire so that she could be eaten…?

;Peggy... What a kind child...
