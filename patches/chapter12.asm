;Man's voice: He should be getting up about now; he should be fine.

;If he takes enough vitamin C he should even get over his fatigue.

;This is what you call "scurvy", you know. If you don't take vitamin C for a long time you're going to contract the disease.

;Karen: Ugh...

;The famous explorer Columbus's troop once contracted the disease. It's not something to concern yourself about.

;If the disease gets worse, your blood goes bad and your skin darkens.

;You bleed from the gums, and soon enough, your body withers…

;Karen: Stop it! I don't want to hear a scary story like that!

;Man: Hahahaha. Well, more importantly, he's safe.

;But, sir, you really know a lot, huh? I'm really grateful.

;If you're going to thank someone, thank the dog outside. After all, they found you two while I was taking them out.

;Karen: Tim! Tim...!! Wake up...!!

;It's land, we've reached land! We've been saved...!!

;Tim: U-uugh...

;Tim: Huh... Karen...? Where in the world are we?

;Karen: The house of a gentleman that saved us.

;Good grief, Tim, you've got bad sleeping posture…

;You're supposed to be a sick person and cling to the sheets, but you're laying on your side like a baby.

;Man: This is the southern outskirts of Oakland.

;If you head northward for about half a day, there's the Capital of Flowers, Freesia.

;I think if you're searching for your friends you were split from, you should try doing it in a big city.

;Karen: Anyhow, let's try going to that city called Freesia.

;I'm going to go give my thanks to the dog. If you're ready you can come talk to me, alright?

;Woof woof...!

;Karen: He said this dog's name is Turbo. They seem like a smart dog, huh.

;Alright, let's go. We'll definitely find Lillie, Rob and Eric.

;Like this, the two head to the Capital of Flowers, Freesia.
