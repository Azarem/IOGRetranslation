;Man's voice: He should be getting up about now; he should be fine.
;If he takes enough vitamin C he should even get over his fatigue.
;This is what you call "scurvy", you know. If you don't take vitamin C for a long time you're going to contract the disease.
;Karen: Ugh…
;The famous explorer Columbus's troop once contracted the disease. It's not something to concern yourself about.
;If the disease gets worse, your blood goes bad and your skin darkens.
;You bleed from the gums, and soon enough, your body withers…
;Karen: Stop it! I don't want to hear a scary story like that!
;Man: Hahahaha. Well, more importantly, he's safe.
;But, sir, you really know a lot, huh? I'm really grateful.
;If you're going to thank someone, thank the dog outside. After all, they found you two while I was taking them out.
