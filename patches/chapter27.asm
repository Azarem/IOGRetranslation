;Metropolis Euro

;Metropolis Euro

;The desert was howling with sandstorms. We crossed it, ending up at Euro.

;Euro was a metropolis greater than anything I could imagine. Busy looking people were running around everywhere.

;Neil's parents live in this town, running the Reuleck Corporation.

;Neil was returning home after three years. After his parents welcomed us, they showed us something awe-worthy...

;Fireworks launching! Line dancers appearing! I felt like the town had just erupted into a whole festival.

;This is the mansion where Neil's parents live. We were led to the guest room next.

;Neil: Well, while you're in this room, please take it easy.

;I'll talk to my parents for a little bit. It's already been three years, hasn't it?

;Eric: This house is so huge, I wonder what I'll do if I want to go pee at night...

;Karen: It's an amaaazing house, isn't it…? I suppose that there are citizens that have more money than kings as of late...

;Ann: So, a man wearing a dark blue mantle came here a few ago.

;He was asking if a girl named Karen hadn't come to this city.

;I cowered from the way he glared with his icy eyes.

;It might be good to tell this to Karen, but... / If that's what you want! / Please don't tell, I'm begging you!

;I can't stomach how that Karen girl acts like such a little lady.

;If that's what you're going to say, I think I'll bully you a little.

;Hehehe. I've gotten a hold of your weak point.

;Aah. I think I want to eat some apples. Go buy them from the market for me!

;Neil's mother: Since we already earn a lot of money, we want you to be able to just have fun for the rest of your life.

;Won't you succeed us..?

;Neil: I guess it's a matter of whether I should live for my own sake or live for the sake of other people...

;This is the mansion where the married couple that serve as the presidents of the Reuleck Corporation live.

;A man named Black Panther or something like that popped up some days ago and went around asking various questions.

;From the look in his eyes, he's got to be an assassin. He could be after someone, but I have no idea who.

;There are a lot of narrow back alleys in this town. You can even enter into the crevices between houses.

;It’s a book by a person named Rofski. It holds predictions about the future of humanity.

;Hey, hey, you mustn't come on this side. Customers should turn to the opposite side...!

;This is a Tearpot. Quite simply, it's a pot for holding tears.

;You know, this town was once dragged into war.

;There's an anecdote that women collected their tears in these pots while they waited for their husbands to return from the war.

;Do you believe in fortune-telling? / Yes / No

;That's how it is, is it? So you're saying that if you have your future told, it's might be a dark future...

;An extremely huge comet is grazing across the Earth… They say that people will die off…

;Well, if that's how it is, all I'm going to do from now on is binge eat...!!

;That's good, isn't it? Me, I'll believe anything…

;This is a fish market. We sell fish that's arrived fresh from Watermia.

;I can't do business when the customer is in the same place as me.

;This is cornmeal. You can use it when making cornbread.

;This is wine. It might be a little too soon for a little boy like to you have, I'd think.

;I saw... A lot of people imprisoned in basement of the chapel...

;This town flourishes by the grace of the Reuleck Corporation.

;There are more than enough bad rumours about them, too, but I still think the company is amazing.

;You're looking at me like you want something... I understand. I'll give you one of these apples.

;Tim received an apple!

;How about a sweet and delicious apple?

;Bright red apple / An apple received in Euro's market.

;You felt a tiny bit relaxed when you filled your mouth with the bright red apple. It was a tasty apple.

;They say that there are people in this town who make it powerful.

;Our fruits and soft and yummy.

;This is the market. You might discover rare goods here.

;This is an office of the Reuleck Corporation. Most of the goods being sold in this town are stocked by that company.

;It seems like they're talking about work...

;Man: I hear that your company trades in all kinds of things… I'm listening, but…

;Company person: Yeah. We do everything. From tea and fruit through to animal pelts...

;Don't say it openly, but we also deal in labour, even in women…

;Man: Nahhh, if this company deals with everything, they've really saved me.

;Company person: U-umm... What's with this kid...?

;Some middle-aged guys are talking about work, so please go play outside or something!

;There's a lot of baggage piled up next to the company, right?

;Sometimes when the baggage is being carried, you can hear groaning from inside. I somehow have a bad feeling about it...

;Max: I'm crazy about joining an expedition to some other land this time...

;But I'm worried because the team leader's so temperamental. Ugh...

;Friesel: I am Friesel, the explorer.

;I want history to remember my name, just like when the now-famous Allman discovered the Tower of Babel.

;Rudy: The truth is, we still have a lot of questions about what we call the ruins, so we've set our hearts on going out on a great journey.

;If I remember correctly, you could find the droplets from mushrooms all over the holy grounds...

;Aah, I didn't mean to talk about grown-up things so early.

;I went with my brother to play on Mount Kehres when I was little. We went to the place that they call the holy grounds and got lost.

;If I remember correctly, there were giant mushrooms and plant stalks sprouting as if they were a maze.

;If the droplets from a mushroom is spilled onto the end of a plant, it will suddenly go into motion and build a path. Everyone else vividly remembers it too.

;The residential area is ahead of here. You can't enter unless you're a townsperson.

;The world-famous literati Rofski and the violinist Elazquez live in this house.

;But the two are constantly quibbling. A lot of geniuses are heard to please, aren't they?

;This is Euro. A lot of the population are merchants in this town.

;Lillie: There's a rumour flying around that a big star is going to collide with the Earth or something like that.

;I'm definitely not going to believe kind of gossip.

;Rob: It seems like my old man is gettin' better day by day...

;It seems like he's able ta talk normally now. I think it would be nice if ya could also meet yer old man soon.

;Oh, that's right. If I remember, I think ya were collectin' Red Jewels.

;I found a Red Jewel from inside my old man's possessions. Take it along.

;Tim received a Red Jewel!

;If would be nice if ya could also meet yer old man soon.

;Rob's father: Oh... Tim, isn't it? I'm sorry; I guess I must have worried you.

;Rob and Lillie really did all they could to nurse me back to health…

;I used to think that I didn't want a child to dominate my life, but now that things have turned out like this, I can see that it's nice to have a child that's loyal to you.

;The Reuleck Corporation has even caused this town to change terribly. It's become a base for merchants due to the company's global growth.

;There's always something hiding behind a growing company, isn't there?

;Wonderful things are being sold in this store.

;Employee: Dear customer..! This is the exit. Please head to the entrance!

;How many times have I lined up for things like this already?

;There's a lot of joy to be found through hardship, isn't there?

;Humanity is seeing a queue and wanting to join it for some reason, right?

;There's a thing being sold in this store called the Medicine of Life or something like that.

;I don't know if it's really effective or what, but I want to live for a long time, so here I am.

;Employee: You're one of the gentlemen that arrived at this town with master Neil, aren't you?!

;The Reuleck Corporation also runs this store.

;Thank you for gracing us with your presence. Please take the items you like.

;Employee: Are you returning home? Thank you very much.

;That is called the Medicine of Darkness. Will you drink it? / Yes / No

;Is that so... Do you not like it?

;It had a scent that irritated your nose...

;However, it seems that Friedan's Power of Darkness grew stronger.

;Dark Fryer's power rose!!

;That is the Medicine of Life. Will you drink it? / Yes / No

;The taste that irritated your mouth…

;However, your endurance rose!!

;I'm sorry... There is a limit of one per person.

;This is the chapel. The presidents of the company are devoutly faithful people, so they often come here.

;Tim: Oh? It seems that wind is blowing in from behind the Madonna...

;Try examining it? / Yes / No

;I understand a little of your language. We were brought here from a distant place...

;We are forced to learn language here, and then are sold off to separate places...

;The bones scattered over there were our companions... If we don't obey an order, that's how it will be for us.

;I want to talk in the language of my motherland... But I'll be beaten if I do that…

;Recently, various diseases have broken out in our homeland…

;There is even an awful disease where the body is turned into stone…

;So I'm escaping to another country, even if it means becoming a slave...

;Two elderly people are arguing about something...

;Rofski: What sort of genius violinist are you? You're at your best when you take your bow and get off the stage..!!

;Elazquez: Hmph! I guess two-bit writers always talk big...!!

;Rofski: We started arguing because of the Tearpot enshrined in the holy grounds of Mount Kehres.

;I believe that the tears shed by the gods were once enshrined at Mount Kehres; there's a legend that they will save mankind.

;Elazquez: You there... I feel from thee a mysterious power...

;I'm already blind, but since I've lost my sight, I've developed a keen sense for things that are clearly special.

;This is perfect. Will you go to the holy grounds of Mount Kehres and see the state of the Tearpot for me?

;Rofski drew the location of Mount Kehres on Tim's map!

;Elazquez: It's said that the tears of the gods in the Tearpot can reflect the true form of things.

;Ann: Thank you. I think I still want to eat one.

;Ann: Why do you keep going back and forth to the market like this, bringing apples for me as many times as I ask..?

;Is it for that Karen girl..? Or...?

;Well, that's alright. As thanks, I'll give you this jewel.

;Tim got a Red Jewel!

;Ann: Take good care of Karen, alright…?
