;Desert town Dao

;We arrived at Dao, a town that stands alone in the desert.

;Eric: This kind of sandstorm hurts my eyes. I can't even walk outside.

;Karen: For a town that people call a hideout for slave merchants, it somehow doesn't feel like you'd expect an infamous town to feel, does it?

;Desert town Dao

;Are you, by chance, Mr. Tim? / Yes / No

;Alright, perfect! I'm delivering a letter and package from people called Bill and Laura. Take them.

;It seems like your inventory is full. Dump your luggage somewhere.

;Got the letter and your father's notepad!

;This house is an inn for merchants that have come from far away.

;Laura's letter / A letter from Laura and Bill.

;Are you doing well? Neil informed us that you seem to be in Dao, so I thought I'd try sending you a letter.

;We heard the gist of the story. Your grandfather and I are looking forward to seeing you come back one size bigger.

;Oh, that's right. We were examining Allman, your father's, luggage. He had written notes about the Pyramid.

;I don't know if it's going to be helpful but I'm sending it along. Well then, make sure to take care of yourself. / Bill/Laura

;Father's notebook / Tim's father, Allman's, notepad. Contains notes about the mystery of the Pyramid.

;I was finally successful in deciphering the ancient characters, the hieroglyphs. This might be the first time in the world they've been translated.

;According to the Book of Revelation, the Pyramid hides the key which can unravel the monumental mysteries of human history.

;ìÖ∞ìäæìÇçìÄÆìÖÄìÉã / The first sentence at the beginning of this hieroglyph means "the sun god rises from the horizon."

;When I progressed to the Pyramid, I discovered plates with the same characters as these. Then...

;The pages are torn here.

;This is the desert town, Dao. I think it's rare to see a normal child in this kind of place.

;Neil: Tim...!! I'm in shock; I can't believe that I'd meet you somewhere like this!

;Neil... How did I run into you here? Didn't you become the president of Reuleck?

;Neil: Hahaha. I was wondering if we couldn't import black pepper as a substitute for the slave trade, you know?

;That brought me all the way to Dao.

;The Pyramid is in this vicinity. Couldn't a Mystery Doll be there?

;I was wondering if we couldn't import black pepper as a substitute for the slave trade, you know? That brought me all the way to Dao.

;I'm now looking after 36 Red Jewels from you.

;Trader: I think I did some good shopping today. I've never seen a rug as wonderful as this. Yeah.

;Kyuui kyuui

;Do you want to play a fun game using these snakes? / Yes / No

;The rules are simple. The snakes come out of the jars, and you compete on how many you can strike in one minute.

;Alright, hit whichever jar you like. When you do that, we'll start...!!

;Whoa, a score of 93! You're very strong, huh?

;Alright, I'll give you two Red Jewels as a prize.

;I'll send them to the jewel merchant for you, alright?

;Okay...! Time to stop...! The number you struck were 91. Please play again!

;It seems that recently a movement's arisen to abolish the slave trade.

;It seems that the Reuleck Corporation's president started that movement himself.

;The specialities in this town are spices such as black pepper as well as carpets.

;It's said that even the carpets in Edward Castle were woven in this town for 40 years.

;Kyuui kyuui

;The girl was silent and held out a paper.

;A picture of a black panther is drawn there!

;A shiver ran down my spine. Could the Black Panther that was supposed to be tracking us have given this as a warning‚Ä¶?

;Have you played Snake Panic? I'm still preparing myself spiritually.

;There's a huge Pyramid in this vicinity.

;Many explorers have come in search of treasure, but there is still no one that has found it.

;How does the Pyramid not sink into the sand even though it's a bunch of huge stones... It's a mystery to me, I guess.

;We're explorers. We came here because we had heard that there‚Äôs treasure sleeping in the Pyramid, but...

;There's a mysterious legend in this region.

;"The Pyramid is a place for the dead. Only those who have surpassed their corporeal bodies are qualified to step inside."

;If it's as those words say... The Pyramid has a giant foundation. Perhaps you can't go inside unless you're dead? Uum.

;These women are weaving carpets.

;It takes them up to 40 years to weave them.

;They start manufacturing them from childhood, without even having playtime. They continue to work. When they are finished, they will be women who passed into middle age.

;Remember this, boy. There are people who are born to a fate like this too.

;It seems that they may not speak your language. But their work continues silently.

;It seems like he may not speak your language. It seems like the boy is trying to petition to you about something with his eyes...

;Hey hey. This isn't a show...! Go over there, go!

;People come all the way to this town to buy slaves...

;Now that it comes down to actually making a purchase, I somehow haven't been able to decide. In the end, I guess that there's no price on human life...
