;TRANSLATION (REVISED)


;Tim: When I regained consciousness, I was standing in a bizarre palace.

;I didn't have any memories from after the parachutes landed in the water... But maybe everyone's safe.

;Tim: This is something strange, isn't it? Even though I touched the enemy, I haven't taken any damage...

;Tim: Oh? I feel a human presence from the room to the right...

;Tim: Oh? I can hear a weak voice coming from somewhere...

;Mysterious voice: Vampires live in this place...

;The fountain of blood in this palace produces demons one by one..

;Tim: Oh? I feel a human presence from the room to the left...

;Eric: Where is this? It's bleak... It's lonely... Mom, help me...

;Mysterious voice: The fountain of blood is on the lowest floor of the palace...

;There… With that stone... Hurry, hur.rrr..ry...

;Lillie: Waah...!!

;Lillie: Geez... Don't surprise me...!!

;My heart nearly jumped out of my chest because of you, you know...!!

;Lillie: I happened to see Eric in the other room just a bit ago, but there was something strange.

;Since his body was half transparent, I could see through to the other side of the room.

;Even if I talked to him, it seemed like his soul was stolen; his entire consciousness is gone...

;Anyhow, let's work together. After all, we don't know what's going on.

;Lillie: I'll borrow your pocket, alright?

;Lillie: Alright. Let's go….

;Mysterious voice: The purification stone in the coffin...

;Karen: Tim... Where? Where are you...??

;Tim: Isn't there an opening in the coffin...?

;Lillie started talking from Tim's pocket.

;Lillie: Wait a moment. This coffin doesn't open?

;I can open it if I go into the hole. Shall I take a look?

;Lillie: That's strange... There's a lock inside this coffin. No wonder it doesn't open, huh?

;Lillie: This coffin doesn't open?

;Lillie: I discovered this weird rock in the coffin.

;Got the purification stone!

;Purification stone / A rock that purifies the fountain of blood in the palace.

;Held up the purification stone!

;However, nothing happened!

;Neil: Ungh, ungh.

;Rob: Ungh, ungh.

;Lillie: Ah...! It's a fountain made of blood...

;I wonder if this is somehow related to that rock we just picked up?

;The stone grew brighter and immediately disappeared into the fountain...

;You saved me, boy! Thank you...!!

;They brought me to this place from Freesia and turned me into a demon...

;Lillie speaks from inside your pocket.

;What...!? So the demons that we were seeing just now were humans...?

;I got a taste of what it's like to die just now. Having an experience even that close to death is a terrifying thing...

;It isn't your fault because you didn't know what was going on, but I wonder if the animals we eat for food also feel that sensation.

;We were originally slave merchants. Arrested for the crime of human trafficking...

;But a damned group of bureaucrats sold us off to vampires! I still can't believe it...

;Good grief... A beautiful woman invited me here and I ended up in this fantastic mess.

;A handsome man asked me to come, so I came here... I still can't believe men!

;There's no doubt about it; vampires sleep and wake in these coffins. Those bastards are planning things too horrible to imagine...

;A vampire husband and wife couple live in this palace.

;Humans are brought here from all over and transformed into demons to be used as a workforce...

;This palace is tied to the fantastical grounds of the continent of Mu. The vampire couple seems to be searching for something there...

;Imagine if you were one step later in rescuing us from being transformed into demons...

;I was eavesdropping on the vampire couple talking; it seems like a puppet called a Mystery Doll or something like that is sleeping at the continent of Mu...

;I snatched a key from the vampire woman. Bring it with you.

;Got the seabed palace key!

;It seems like there is a passage that leads to the continent of Mu at the highest floor of the palace.

;Palace key / A key that opens the passage to continent of Mu.

;What should we do after left in the middle of the sea like this…?

;What will happen to everyone who was abducted and brought to this palace?

;Tried using the palace key.

;Lillie begins to speak from your pocket.

;The passage ahead of here leads to the fantastic continent of Mu, right?

;Lillie: It's a long passage, huh... I wonder if this really goes on to the continent of Mu...
