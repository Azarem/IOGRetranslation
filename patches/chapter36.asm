;Tim. Don't you know that blue star floating in the darkness somehow?
;Tim: That's our planet...?
;Tim's father: That's right. That's our planet, the Earth.
;Doesn't it seem like an oasis in the desert?
;Karen: So the thing that we called the Earth was something so pretty?

;Sometimes Tim remembered us. Karen, did you sometimes think of your parents?
;The Earth is the same. It's lonely when it is forgotten by its children.
;Tim's father: How is it? Both of you? What do you feel, gazing from the outside at the planet you yourselves lived on?
;Karen: It's as if we've become God...
;Tim: I want to show this to Rob and everyone...
;No, I want to show this scenery to people throughout the world...
;Tim's father: Humanity will eventually on their own power invent a ship that can go to space.
;Then they will be able to see this blue Earth with their own eyes.
;When that happens, I want them to see the Earth making a lovely face like it is for the two of you.
;Tim's father: Look. Please look closely at the map of the world you're holding.
;Tim: Ah. The shapes on the map are starting to change...!

;Tim's father: Living things have evolved until this point through mistaken evolution by the comet's power.

;Tim's father: When I lost my corporeal body, it was as if I became able to see everything.
;Events of the past, events of the future, and even the path that humanity is following.
;Perhaps people would call a being with a body like this a god.
;Tim's mother: Anyhow, with everything being done, you two can turn back into normal children as well.
;It's okay not to think about scary things anymore.
;Karen: Will we become separated when the Earth has reverted?
;Tim's father: That's right... As the Earth is changing too, even people and history will begin to walk new paths.
;Supposing even that you two encounter each other at a street corner somewhere, you probably won't recognize each other...
;But I guess that when the Earth needs the Warrior of Light and Darkness, perhaps you two will happen to meet again.
;Well, please head to Earth before the comet's power vanishes completely.
