;Shadow: When I came to, I was at a place that was familiar to me…

;Karen: I wonder what will become of the comet..?

;And what in the world is that huge, shining blue star out there?

;Tim's father: The comet has lost its power.

;The star of the devil will now fly off into space…

;Tim. Don't you know that blue star floating in the darkness somehow?

;Tim: That's our planet...?

;Tim's father: That's right. That's our planet, the Earth.

;Doesn't it seem like an oasis in the desert?

;Karen: So the thing that we called the Earth was something so pretty?

;But shining alone in the darkness, it seems somehow lonely...

;Mysterious voice: That's right. The Earth is lonesome.

;Tim: Mom...!?

;Tim's mother: The Earth... A mother that has hundreds of millions of children.

;Sometimes Tim remembered us. Karen, did you sometimes think of your parents?

;The Earth is the same. It's lonely when it is forgotten by its children.

;Tim's father: How is it? Both of you? What do you feel, gazing from the outside at the planet you yourselves lived on?

;Karen: It's as if we've become God...

;Tim: I want to show this to Rob and everyone...

;No, I want to show this scenery to people throughout the world...

;Tim's father: Humanity will eventually on their own power invent a ship that can go to space.

;Then they will be able to see this blue Earth with their own eyes.

;When that happens, I want them to see the Earth making a lovely face like it is for the two of you.

;Tim's father: Look. Please look closely at the map of the world you're holding.

;Tim: Ah. The shapes on the map are starting to change...!

;Tim: The land transformed into a strange shape somehow.

;Tim's father: That's the new world.

;Karen: New world?

;Tim's father: Living things have evolved until this point through mistaken evolution by the comet's power.

;The Earth is also a life. Its form had been changed by similar evolution.

;The world should return to its original form now that the comet's power no longer reaches it.

;Tim: Dad and Mom, how do you know the events of the future?

;Tim's father: When I lost my corporeal body, it was as if I became able to see everything.

;Events of the past, events of the future, and even the path that humanity is following.

;Perhaps people would call a being with a body like this a god.

;Tim's mother: Anyhow, with everything being done, you two can turn back into normal children as well.

;It's okay not to think about scary things anymore.

;Karen: Will we become separated when the Earth has reverted?

;Tim's father: That's right... As the Earth is changing too, even people and history will begin to walk new paths.

;Supposing even that you two encounter each other at a street corner somewhere, you probably won't recognize each other...

;But I guess that when the Earth needs the Warrior of Light and Darkness, perhaps you two will happen to meet again.

;Well, please head to Earth before the comet's power vanishes completely.

;Tim's mother: It would be great if a wonderful future came to visit the two of you, wouldn't it…?

;Karen: Tim... Come this way... And show me your face closely...

;I want it to be firmly burned into my mind.

;Your eyes, your nose, your mouth, your hair, your voice, and even your warmth...

;Tim: You don't have to worry. Because I will definitely find you.

;No matter how many years it takes, even if takes a hundred years, even if it takes a thousand years, I will come to meet you again.

;So be at ease... And shut your eyes…

;Karen: Tim…

;Tim: Well, let's go. To the Earth…

;Karen: Yeah…

;The way that the Earth was dressed had greatly changed, but the world dyed in madder red was as beautiful as ever.

;Even as the forests became swarms of buildings, rivers became the flow of automobile traffic, the cities were flooding with people's smiling faces.

;Only the Earth alone seemed lonely.

;When we wake up tomorrow morning, Karen and I will begin our new lives.

;The Tower of Babel of the year 1993 towered above as if it knew everything in Earth's future.
