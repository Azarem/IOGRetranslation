;Great Wall of China

;Rob's tracks led me to the Great Wall of China.

;The passageway continued without end beyond the horizon...

;A pretty pebble has fallen.

;Aha! This is a part of the necklace that Rob made for Lillie...

;You picked up the necklace's stone for him.

;Necklace's stones / A pendant that Rob made for Lillie.

;It's the necklace that Rob made for Lillie...

;Wait!!

;Lillie: You're going to search for Rob, right?

;I'm going too...!!

;Lillie: Eheheh. It's been a long time since I've borrowed your pocket like this, huh?

;Alright, let's go…

;Tim's power Spin Dash can jump to ascend slopes that are too sleep to climb.

;There are many hills here in the Great Wall of China. Try attempting it in various places.

;It seems that the Power of Darkness Spin Dash become usable!

;Spin Dash is a power that only Tim, the boy, can use.

;Thine own high-speed rotation can send enemies flying. Thou can run up hills that use recoil.

;Thou shouldst alternate between L and R while holding the attack button…

;Power of Darkness / :Spin Dash / Spin Dash / Ramming attack while spinning. Can ascend slopes with recoil.

;Eat a Medicinal Herb? / Yes / No

;The Medicinal Herb brought your lost power back when put it in your mouth.

;After you defeated Sand Fanger, you found a Mystery Doll from its corpse!!

;Lillie: Rob, you idiot…You had me worried...!!

;What would you do if the demons killed you...!!

;Rob: It's my bad fer worryin' everyone.

;But I obtained medicine ta cure my old man's illness.

;Lillie: Geez… He's selfish, after all...

;Rob: Ah, those stones are...

;Tim: We arrived here when we followed these pebbles. I'll return the stones to you. Here you go…

;Rob whispered...

;Rob: Tim... Won't ya leave me with Lillie fer just a little bit?

;Rob: I was saved with tha help o' these stones...

;Tha truth is, I made this fer ya...

;Rob: Tha stones in tha necklace ended up bein' awfully small, but won't ya take it fer me?

;Rob gently affixed the necklace onto Lillie's neck..

;Rob: Ah…

;Lillie: I won't run away this time...

;The last time I did this, I wasn't expecting what you did. I was surprised and didn't know what I should do...

;But right now, I just don't want you to be able to see my face.

;I'm so happy that my tears are flooding out...

;Lillie: Rob.. From the time when we first met, I felt something that was different...

;But now I have a feel that I understand what that something is...

;The reply I had for you back then... The reply that I wanted to give you...

;Lillie: I care about you, too...

;It would be nice if we could always be together, wouldn't it…?
