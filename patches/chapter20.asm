;TRANSLATION (REVISED)

;Continent of Mu

;Tim: Lillie and I set foot upon the continent of Mu.

;Would the continent that was awoken from numerous millennia of sleep welcome us…?

;Inside was nothing!

;Prayer room

;Lillie: Hey Tim. I was thinking a little;

;doesn't it look like these stone statues are staring at something?

;Look, the treasure box over there is where the two statues' lines of sight cross, right?

;If that's the case, I was thinking if the other statues aren't also staring at something. I guess I could be overthinking it.

;Found a prayer statue! Prayer statue... Wasn't there a room somewhere with the same name...?

;Prayer statue / A statue loaded with the prayers of Mu's people.

;Offered the prayer statue!

;An eerie voice could be heard descending from somewhere...

;O god of the sun... O Ra Mu...

;Bestow your power upon the great ocean...

;Lillie: Ah...! The water level's been reduced from what it was just now...!

;We can now descend to a lower level from somewhere, can't we...!?

;When thou began thy journey, the Mu continent surfaced to the sea level.

;However, seawater has still accumulated on many sections of the continent.

;When all of this water has been removed, thou wilt probably arrive at the place where the Mu continent's king, Ra Mu, sleeps.

;With Tim's power, Psycho Slider, thou canst lower thyself and pass through narrow passages.

;Thou shouldst pay attention so not to overlook crevices that thou wouldst pass by.

;You've become able to use the Power of Darkness, Psycho Slider!

;Psycho Slider is a power that only the young man, Tim, can use.

;Thou art now able to do a sliding attack. Again, thou wilt also pass through narrow passages.

;Thou shouldst push the attack button whilst running.

;Power of Darkness / :Psycho Dash / :Psycho Slider / Psycho Slider / Do a sliding attack. Pass through narrow passages.

;Found Ra Mu's statue!

;Ra Mu's statue / A statue that can release Ra Mu's seal.

;Offered Ra Mu's statue!

;It looks like this was the cemetery for Mu's people...

;I am the king of the continent of Mu, Ra Mu. Though I lost my corporeal body in the distant past, my spirit continues to live on.

;Alright, strain your eyes well. The wandering souls should be visible.

;You should listen to the words of the souls that have awakened from their sleep.

;A beam of light once shone in from the heavens. We thought it was the light of the gods and knelt before it.

;One year after we saw the light of the gods, our bodies started to undergo a change.

;Some people became thin, some people grew to look like boulders, and some people even melted away so that they looked like water...

;Our family and friends transformed to monsters before our very eyes and stormed in to attack us. We were shedding tears as we raised our weapons against them...

;We couldn't bear this awful state of affairs, so there were more than a few people who thought we should escape from here.

;However, the continent of Mu is an island on the deep blue sea. Beyond that, there was no guarantee that we would be able to arrive in some other place where we could live...

;This island did not have the material for a ship. It would immediately sink if we had constructed it from stone...

;What meaning would there even be in going on living if it went on like this…?

;People started to dig an undersea tunnel. We didn't know how many centuries... no, how many millennia this plan that we had entrusted our hopes into would take, but they continued digging...

;The undersea tunnel that the people had dug is inside here.

;And with that, please take this Mystery Doll.

;Eric: Waaaaaaah... Somebody saaave me...!!

;Vampire man: You did well, finding the Mystery Doll for us!

;I was thinking that someone strange had turned up at the palace but... Pshaw. I was right to let you free.

;Vampire woman: What are you going on about? Even though you starting drooling when anything that resembles prey turns up...!

;Every little time that you manage to get a hold of a few young children, you're always like that...! Do you think of nothing but eating...?

;Vampire man: You're one to talk!

;Hey, wait. Now isn't the situation to be having a lover's quarrel.

;First off, let's take that Mystery Doll. You there! Prepare yourself...!!

;Vampire woman: Hmph. That man's dead; what a relief. Alright, it's your turn next...!! Get ready...!!

;Before anything else, stop the booomb...! Hurry hurry...!!

;It seems that both a red wire and a blue wire are hanging out of the bomb...

;Which will you cut? / Go with red / Go with blue

;Ripped out the red line!

;Tim: It looks like the bomb stopped somehow...

;Eric: I'm saaaved...

;Lillie: Sorry Tim... Even though I was with you, I couldn't do anything...

;My legs froze and couldn't move at all, even my voice wouldn't come out... You're a boy after all, aren't you.

;I thought I was reliable until now, but this is how it is when it comes down to it...

;...Sorry, I'll still take up your pocket for a while.

;Eric: I won't tell anyone that you transformed.

;Neil: Tim...! Are you safe...?!

;Rob: Tim...! I couldn't see any sign of Lillie; how's she doin'...?!

;Lillie: I'm here…

;Lillie: Sorry for making you worry. But I had Tim to protect me so I'm okay…

;Neil: Oh? Tim's turned out to be very manly too, hasn't he?

;Karen: Who cares about that!

;More importantly, let's think how to get off of the continent of Mu...!

;Lillie: You don't have to worry about that. We heard something good from someone just now; they were named Ra Mu or something like that.

;Tim told everyone about the continent of Mu, the people who crossed over through the undersea tunnel, and so on...

;Karen: It's a sad story, isn't it…?

;The people who were living were together were scattered, and even more so when once they arrive at the other side on the bottom of the sea…

;Neil: Anyway, if we pass through that undersea tunnel, then we should be able to get out, shouldn't we?

;Rob: Alright...! If we've decided on that, let's go immediately...!
