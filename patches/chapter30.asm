;It was the village of a cannibal tribe!
;The troop leader and I took a sidelong glance at bones that our comrades had been reduced to and escaped. We kept wandering; then we discovered Angkor Wat.
;There were rumours that said that there are gods living here who had obtained eternal life, but all that our eyes could see were the figures of demons...
;So now I'll be departing to be by my comrades' sides too... I'll be leaving this world and I won't exist anymore. Is there anyone mourning me?
