;Angkor Wat entrance

;If you push through the jungle from the aboriginal's village for at most three days, you’re met with a gigantic temple.

;Outer circumference pathway

;Courtyard

;Could this be what remains of a lost explorer that was enchanted by this lost history?

;Oh? They're clutching something like a notebook... / Try to read it / Leave it be

;We pushed through the jungle and managed to arrive at an aboriginal village. We couldn't speak their language, but we stayed with a generous villager, and they beckoned to us.

;When we awoke the next morning, we saw that there was no one left but the troop leader Friesel and myself...

;It was the village of a cannibal tribe!

;The troop leader and I took a sidelong glance at bones that our comrades had been reduced to and escaped. We kept wandering; then we discovered Angkor Wat.

;There were rumours that said that there are gods living here who had obtained eternal life, but all that our eyes could see were the figures of demons...

;So now I'll be departing to be by my comrades' sides too... I'll be leaving this world and I won't exist anymore. Is there anyone mourning me?

;Inner circumference pathway

;Friedan's power Earthquaker cause an earthquake; the enemies in that area aren't able to move for a while.

;Became able to use the Power of Darkness, Earthquaker!

;Earthquaker is a Power of Darkness that can only be used by the Friedan, the Warrior of Darkness.

;This causes an earthquake and enemies are unable to move for a while.

;Thou shouldst try pushing the attack button during a descending leap.

;Path to the main shrine

;Something that looks like a journal has fallen under their arm... / Try to read it / Leave it be

;Angkor Wat examination record / Friesel

;Angkor Wat is a temple where gods are said to live.

;I finally arrived at the main building; in the second floor is an area filled with light.

;You have to pass through there to meet with the gods at the highest floor, but I can't; the light in the passage is too strong to be able to see anything.

;There is also a legend that glasses made from black quartz were once used to meet with the gods.

;I momentarily caught sight of a shining black thing on the ground when I was around the central hall leading down to the main building. But demons were in my way, so I had to escape.

;Perhaps the legendary glasses were there...

;It's a shame that it turned out this way even though I came all the way here... I pray that my child follows in my footsteps...

;Main shrine 1F

;Main shrine 2F

;When you took your first step onto this floor, the crystals that were floating in midair began to glow!

;Angkor Wat is a wandering temple.

;It is said that its form hides in the jungle when people approach and quietly stand still…

;And on the highest floor, thou shalt probably come to know why thou art on this journey.

;There's something shiny buried in the ground.

;Found the black quartz glasses!

;Black glasses / Glasses made of black quartz. It seems that even intense light can be blocked with these...

;Power of Darkness / :Earthquaker / Earthquaker / Causes an earthquake that stops enemies from moving.

;Power of Darkness / :Aura Barrier / Aura Barrier / Causes a barrier of darkness to rotate around you.

;These are glasses made of black quartz. It seems that even intense light can be blocked with these...

;Main shrine 3F

;Main shrine 4F

;Tim... For thousands of years, I have waited for thy arrival.

;Tim: Who…? Are you..?

;I'm dreaming. Yet time still flows as I dream, and my body became like this.

;I shall show thee a mysterious image. Close thine eyes.



;Tim: What the….? What I just saw…

;It's the new world...

;Tim: There was nothing but grey in that world, was there…?

;Isn't the world something that's covered in blue water, green mountains, and brown earth?

;Thou shalt now bring about that world...

;Tim: I'm going to...? An unsettling world like that?!

;In place of the trees, there will only be swarms of high-rise buildings. In the place of flowing rivers, there will only be the flows of automobile traffic...

;Whichever kind of world a person is in, if they think they're happy, they're happy.

;Well, please return to the aboriginals' village. Restore the people who have been turned to stone back to their original forms.

;Please return the people who have been changed to grey back to their natural state.

;When the dazzling light was gone, I was standing around as if nothing had happened.

;But I found that the Gorgon's flower was being grasped in my hand..

;Got the Gorgon's flower!

;Gorgon's flower / Restores things that have been turned to stone back to their original forms.

;Gazed at the Gorgon's flower... However, nothing happened!

;Karen: The children taught me a word.

;It seems that "ramapou" means "hello" in this region.

;Put one Gorgon's petal into the statue's mouth!

;It seems that she doesn't speak your language...

;Karen: Just now, I was speaking with the people of this village with gestures, right.

;Based on that, it seems like the animals are returning in the forest. Everyone can stop cannibalizing each other with this, can't they?

;The girl is silent and holds out a Red Jewel. She probably intends it as thanks..

;Tim got a Red Jewel!

;Eric: They say that even though this village is facing a food shortage, slave merchants were taking advantage and kidnapped children.

;It's an awful story, isn't it?

;It seems that slave merchants arrived from a town in the northwest and were taking villagers away from here.

;I can't tolerate them taking advantage and selling children when there's no food and the people are suffering!

;Heeey, won't we try going to that slave merchant town? / Yeah, let's go! / Wait a bit

;Well, when you're ready to go, come back here, alright?

;Alright, heaaading out!!
