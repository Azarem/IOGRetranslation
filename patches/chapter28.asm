;A mysterious place extended from Mount Kehres' summit.

;I had never seen so many mushrooms crowded together, or plant stalks tangled together...

;Dark Fryer / Dark Fryer / A shockwave flies from the blade.

;Found mushroom's droplets!

;Mushroom's droplets / The end of a stalk will return to life when this is spilled on it.

;Tried using the mushroom's droplets.

;However, nothing happened!

;Whoops, the number of jewels you've collected have passed 30, haven't they...! Going by the list, I'll give you Dark Power.

;This is a mysterious, otherworldly power that I will award you from my soul.

;It seems that it will raise your Dark Power.

;You should try pushing the attack button one more time after firing your Dark Fryer.

;Poured the mushroom's droplets at the place where the stalk ends!

;Thou canst make planks of aura revolve around thee by using Friedan's power, Aura Barrier.

;The enemies in the mountain's holy grounds are strong. It should be significantly easier to fight using this power.

;It seems you can now use the Power of Darkness, Aura Barrier!

;Aura Barrier is a Power of Darkness that is only usable by Friedan, the Warrior of Darkness.

;Thou canst create a barrier composed of thy aura around thee with this power.

;Thou shouldst push L and R alternatively while holding the attack button…

;Found the Tearpot!

;Tearpot / A pot said to have contain the tears of gods.

;Tried using the Tearpot.

;Throw away the will? / No / Yes

;Which of your possessions will you throw away?

;Rofski: Oh, that is definitely the Tearpot... It really exists, does it…?

;Elazquez: The presence of demons is the air in this town...

;I feel that demons have switched places with some of the townspeople.

;It might be people travelling through the plaza, it might be your friend, it might be me.

;You should try to use the Tearpot on characters that you think are suspicious.

;The tears of the gods showered down!

;Race of the Moon: Mweheheheheheheh... Darkness will soon envelop this world, too.

;The owners of the bodies we were using a moment ago have become bones sleeping in the basement of the chapel.

;Neil: …

;Even though I understood how my parents had welcomed me after I had been separated from my family...

;Tim... It might be inconveniencing you, but could you leave me alone for a while…?

;Neil hung his head as spoke... It was the first time I had ever seen Neil like this...

;Guest room

;However, the next morning. Unfortunate news was waiting for us...

;Neil: Good morning. I guess I've caused everyone to worry...

;I've been thinking about it all night, but in the end I feel like this company can't continue unless I inherit it.

;I want to do something to stop the slave trade; I was thinking that the company that first established that slave trade should work towards it...

;I guess there's no way around exchanging human misery for money.

;Karen: So, that must mean Neil's going to become the president of the company? Cooooool!!

;Neil: Hehe. I'm feeling kind of embarrassed for some reason.

;Neil: Ah, and from that, Karen. There's a person who came to visit you. You've talked before about your old sweetheart.

;Karen: Huh...!?

;Neil: Hey, come in...!

;Karen: Peggy...!

;Squee squee...!

;How?! Was she okay?!

;Neil: Hahaha. It seems like she was chasing after you all the way.

;Lillie discovered her in the Floating City and sent her for us. You could call it Reuleck's delivery service.

;Even though I'm no longer one of your travel companions, aren't you gaining even more powerful allies?

;Eric: I don't understand girls at all.

;Squee squee...

;Karen: It seems that if we head to the west of here, we'd reach the ruins of Angkor Wat.

;It seems that the native land of the slaves is in exactly that same place.

;Alright, let's go check it out!
