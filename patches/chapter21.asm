;Five days passed since we entered the undersea tunnel.
;The scenery looks the same no matter how much you walk. We began to feel overwhelmed...
;Neil: How about we rest here for today?
;Eric: I'm exhaaausted. I think we walked about a thousand kilometres today.
;Rob: Don't be stupid. Human legs can't walk that far.
;Karen: Geez, I can't stand it it...! This journey's been nothing but one exhausting event after another…
;Lillie: Everybody's thinking the same thing, so be quiet...!
;More importantly, let's eat. I'm hungry.

;Tim: I don't understand it well myself, but…
;I'm able to use mysterious powers; you've seen me transform into the form of a warrior, right?
;After the expedition with my dad at the Tower of Babel, my body had changed.
;I have a hunch that I'll understand the secrets of my power through this journey.
;By the way, Lillie, why did you tag along in such a dangerous journey?
;Lillie: At first, it was half for fun. But now it's a private matter. Ehehe.
;Since we won't be able to avoid a lot of walking tomorrow... I'll be going to bed soon, okay?
