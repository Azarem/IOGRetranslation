;Undersea tunnel

;Five days passed since we entered the undersea tunnel.

;The scenery looks the same no matter how much you walk. We began to feel overwhelmed...

;Neil: How about we rest here for today?

;Eric: I'm exhaaausted. I think we walked about a thousand kilometres today.

;Rob: Don't be stupid. Human legs can't walk that far.

;Karen: Geez, I can't stand it it...! This journey's been nothing but one exhausting event after another…

;Lillie: Everybody's thinking the same thing, so be quiet...!

;More importantly, let's eat. I'm hungry.

;Eric: I'm peeing, so don't come look!

;Rob: Where tha heck does this underground tunnel go on to...

;Neil: I guess that even millennia ago, there must have been people walking through this underground tunnel.

;I can't help but think of myself a little when I think of the distant past.

;Lillie: Humans are mysterious, aren't we…?

;When you're pushed to the absolute limit, you might know with a glance if something is edible of it's poisonous.

;I wonder if it was that was for the people of the past.

;Karen: Aah, I want to eat a steak...! I want to eat a salad...!!

;My skin is already turning dry because we're only eating weird things...

;We found these mushrooms living in this tunnel when we arrived. They're our only source of food.

;Yesterday was fried mushrooms. The day before yesterday was boiled mushrooms.

;When we ate them raw three days ago they were frightfully disgusting...

;But we can't concern ourselves with luxuries like flavour. We're being patient in order to live, but when it comes to having an empty stomach...

;Karen: Oh gosh. Tim found mushrooms again...

;Lillie: You have to think of it as being better than starving to death. Alright, let's eat…

;Like this, one day again passed slowly...

;Eighth day since entering the tunnel. Unable to sleep, I was staring at an underground water stream..

;Lillie: Can't sleep?

;Tim: Yeah, it's because I'm getting hungry. …I'm kidding.

;Lillie: Speaking of, Tim. As our journey continues, we’ve changed a lot, haven't we?

;You could say that we've matured somehow.

;Tim: I don't understand it well myself, but…

;I'm able to use mysterious powers; you've seen me transform into the form of a warrior, right?

;After the expedition with my dad at the Tower of Babel, my body had changed.

;I have a hunch that I'll understand the secrets of my power through this journey.

;By the way, Lillie, why did you tag along in such a dangerous journey?

;Lillie: At first, it was half for fun. But now it's a private matter. Ehehe.

;Since we won't be able to avoid a lot of walking tomorrow... I'll be going to bed soon, okay?

;Two weeks since entering the undersea tunnel. We still can't see an exit...

;Karen: Hey hey. Were there eerie sounds coming from above the tunnel when we were sleeping last night?

;Rob: I think ya often notice those sort o' sounds...

;That ain't it; ya were just getting' tired.

;Karen: Listen... You can hear it even now...! I wonder what it is... That sound...

;Eric: Could it be a Leviathan...?

;Karen: This is bad...!! Run away!!

;Lillie: You can tell us to run away, but where the heck do we run to...!?

;Neil: Everyone, be quiet...! This repeating vibration sound...

;This is Morse code...

;When boats contact each other, they use signals where the length of sounds map up to words.

;I can try to decode a bit of it, so please wait...

;I'm Morris...

;Rob: Did ya say it's Morris?!

;Lillie: Shh... Be quiet... Neil's about to continue.

;I was swallowed by a Leviathan...

;And then, when I regained consciousness, my body had been transformed into the form of a Leviathan.

;These life forms that we call Leviathans may be understood as humans that live in the sea.

;From what my fellow Leviathans say, the light of the comet distorts the evolution of living things or something like that.

;I'd join you on your journey again, but my body's like this, so…

;Please stay strong anyway, and bring the mysteries of the comet and the ruins to light...

;Neil: I can't hear it anymore…

;Karen: Morris... I pity him…

;Rob: Now that ya mention it, I guess that guy must have studied Morse code.

;Morris has learned sophisticated things too, hadn't he.

;Eric: But Morris no longer is in human form...!!

;Neil: Nah, Eric. I don't think you should assume it's a bad thing.

;We may only think that the human body is the best one because we're just humans.

;Alright. Keep your spirits up and let's go ahead!!
