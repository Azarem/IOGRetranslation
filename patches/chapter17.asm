;Neil's cabin

;Nazca lines

;Nazca

;Nazca plain

;Neil: It was a long walk, but I think everyone held up well.

;This is the most famous image of the Nazca lines, the condor. You've at least heard of it, right?

;We still don't know why in the world the people of ancient times drew things like this.

;Well, anyhow. Even if you travel here, the scale of the area can overwhelm you.

;Before anything else, everyone may want take a look by themselves first.

;Lillie: Awesome, aren't they? The people from ancient times. How could they have drawn these…?

;Rob: I suppose that until tha other day, I've been spendin' all o' my days doin' things like commutin' to and from school, studyin', and playin'.

;I couldn't even dream that I'd be here…

;Eric: I'm scared for some reason... I'll be close to Neil.

;Neil: Ha ha ha. Don't rush like that. Go sightseeing with everyone first.

;Karen: If you look at it like this, it looks kind of like the white lines on a school playground on track and field day.

;Surprisingly, the ancient Nazca people were doing the 100-meter dash here, weren't they?

;Lillie: Isn't it somehow natural how these stones are scattered around?

;Karen: This is exactly where the condor's stomach would be, isn't it? Don't you think that if you dig here, you'll find eggs or something like that?

;I-I'm joking. (Laughs) I'm not really going to search for them.

;Mweheheheheheh…

;Karen: It probably feels great to draw a huge picture on a natural canvas like this, being able to feel the wind, having nothing else to distract you.

;Eric: What's going to happen…? I'm getting excited.

;Neil: Aaallright, now that everyone's back, let's get to the main question.

;The thing that Tim was calling a Mystery Doll is probably going to be somewhere in this plain, right?

;Eric: The thought came to me when I was looking at the drawing on the ground just now;

;don't you think that you can kind of see the form of a swan in this condor image?

;Neil: That's it...! You've figured it out...!!

;We've been comparing the arrangement of the stars in that constellation to a swan, but as far as the ancient people of Nazca were concerned, it might have been a condor.

;Lillie: Aaaaaaaaaaah...!! I've got it...!!

;Look, look...! The location of the stones on the surface of the ground...!!

;They're definitely in the positions of the stars in the constellation of Cygnus...!

;Neil: That's it...! There are nine stars in the constellation of Cygnus, and there are also nine stones...

;In that case, where would the red star that we've started seeing recently be...?

;The condor's head / The condor's right leg / The condor's left leg / The condor's tail

;Tim: No, wait. It should be underneath the constellation of Cygnus...

;Tim: That's it...! It would be right in the joint of the left leg!

;Neil: Alright...! Let's try to examine that part of the left leg!

;Lillie: A mystery hidden in a constellation; it's really romantic somehow, isn't it?

;Rob: I wonder if we're now revealin' a mystery that hasn't been solved yet by explorers and archaeologists..

;Karen: My heart is pounding at being able to experience something like this...

;Neil: I think things like this are nice on occasion. My heart is pounding like when I'm inventing.

;Something like a tile is buried in the sand...

;As Tim's flute touched it, something started to roar!

;Eric: Wah...! It looks like something huge is descending from above us...!!

;Karen: Aah...! Tim...!! Tiiiiiiiiiiim...!!
