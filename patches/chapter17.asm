;Neil: It was a long walk, but I think everyone held up well.
;This is the most famous image of the Nazca lines, the condor. You've at least heard of it, right?
;We still don't know why in the world the people of ancient times drew things like this.
;Well, anyhow. Even if you travel here, the scale of the area can overwhelm you.
;Before anything else, everyone may want take a look by themselves first.

;Karen: If you look at it like this, it looks kind of like the white lines on a school playground on track and field day.
;Surprisingly, the ancient Nazca people were doing the 100-meter dash here, weren't they?

;Karen: This is exactly where the condor's stomach would be, isn't it? Don't you think that if you dig here, you'll find eggs or something like that?
;I-I'm joking. (Laughs) I'm not really going to search for them.

;Neil: Aaallright, now that everyone's back, let's get to the main question.
;The thing that Tim was calling a Mystery Doll is probably going to be somewhere in this plain, right?
;Eric: The thought came to me when I was looking at the drawing on the ground just now;
;don't you think that you can kind of see the form of a swan in this condor image?
;Neil: That's it...! You've figured it out...!!
;We've been comparing the arrangement of the stars in that constellation to a swan, but as far as the ancient people of Nazca were concerned, it might have been a condor.
