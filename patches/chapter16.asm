;TRANSLATION (REVISED)


;Neil's Cottage

;Neil's cabin

;Neil: It's open, so come in if you want…

;Tim: Neil. It's me. It's Tim from South Cape.

;Neil: Oh...! Well, if it isn't Tim...!! I guess you've developed a terribly resolute will.

;With that, the rest of you that are swarming in, are you Tim's friends?

;Karen: This guy kinda stiiiinks...

;Lillie: How can you say something like that...!? You should be able to word it better...!!

;Come on, it's a wonderful nose-irritating smell drifting through the room or something, right?

;Neil: Hey! You two little ladies are both terrible blunt, aren't you.

;The thing is, you come not to care about your appearance when you're focusing on inventing.

;But I suppose I thought that people wouldn't hate my odour that much...

;It still hasn't even been past a month since I started wearing these socks.

;Rob: My record's three weeks, but I guess I’m losing...

;Karen: Come on, I can't even believe these people...!

;It's gross that I've already had to breathe that same air...!!

;Neil: So, that's enough about socks already...

;Well, anyway, please relax. I guess you must be Tim's friends. Welcome to my humble home.

;Eric: I guess Morris would have been delighted to see these inventions...

;Neil: That's the oxygen tank. I've put air inside.

;If you're wearing that, you can even breathe underwater. However, it can only hold roughly a minute of air.

;If I could compress the air, you could probably dive for a long time, I haven't thought of the method to do that yet.

;Neil: Those are aeroplane wings.

;It's a wonderful machine that fulfills mankind's dream of flying through the air like a bird; those wings are just one part of it.

;The rest of the main body is large, and even more than that, it needs a runway to take off. So it's in the desert.

;That's the telescope. With it, you can see the stars of the heavens as if you could take them in your hand.

;That's the camera. It's a device that can burn the image of the landscape onto photographic paper identically.

;The flaw is that copying it takes nearly 30 minutes.

;The landscape doesn't move so that's fine, but people have to go on without even blinking for thirty minutes when you're photographing them.

;The image of your eyes ends up turning bright red like a rabbit's when using this device.

;Neil: Tim, where are you going? You took the trouble of coming here, so relax a while longer before you go.

;Anyway, you came here because I can do something for you, right? Please tell me what you need.

;Tim told Neil about the events that happened until now; hearing the voice of his missing father,

;searching for the Mystery Dolls that are spread across ruins throughout the world, and so on.

;Neil: Hohoho... I think that's a very interesting story...

;I’m a little interested in ancient ruins too, you know?

;The ruins that you've told me are scattered all over the world, but there's a mysterious connection between them.

;If you draw a line on the world map between all the ruins you've been to so far, it somehow forms a huge image of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan.

;Karen: You said it was Cygnus?!

;Neil: Right. Beyond that, the Tower of Babel that Tim's dad was said to have disappeared in,

;ends up being exactly in the middle of that giant swan.

;Lillie: Well, now that you mention it, there's been a new red star underneath Cygnus as of late…

;Neil: Exactly...! You know a lot, don't you?

;Between the new star appearing in Cygnus and Tim's talk of ruins,

;these various elements are tied together too neatly for it to happen organically...

;I don't know if it's coincidence or conspiracy, but the fact is that something is going to happen.

;However, the circumstances are good. The desert of the Nazca lines is at most a day's walk to the east from here.

;Will you check it out? / Yes / No

;Neil: Alright...! I guess it's settled then.

;Rob: We're going too...! Tim won't be tha only one who can have fun memories.

;The party headed to the Nazca desert...
