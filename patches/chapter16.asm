;Neil: Hey! You two little ladies are both terrible blunt, aren't you.
;The thing is, you come not to care about your appearance when you're focusing on inventing.
;But I suppose I thought that people wouldn't hate my odour that much...
;It still hasn't even been past a month since I started wearing these socks.

;Neil: That's the oxygen tank. I've put air inside.
;If you're wearing that, you can even breathe underwater. However, it can only hold roughly a minute of air.
;If I could compress the air, you could probably dive for a long time, I haven't thought of the method to do that yet.

;Neil: Those are aeroplane wings.
;It's a wonderful machine that fulfills mankind's dream of flying through the air like a bird; those wings are just one part of it.
;The rest of the main body is large, and even more than that, it needs a runway to take off. So it's in the desert.

;That's the camera. It's a device that can burn the image of the landscape onto photographic paper identically.
;The flaw is that copying it takes nearly 30 minutes.
;The landscape doesn't move so that's fine, but people have to go on without even blinking for thirty minutes when you're photographing them.
;The image of your eyes ends up turning bright red like a rabbit's when using this device.

;Tim told Neil about the events that happened until now; hearing the voice of his missing father,
;searching for the Mystery Dolls that are spread across ruins throughout the world, and so on.
;Neil: Hohoho... I think that's a very interesting story...
;I’m a little interested in ancient ruins too, you know?
;The ruins that you've told me are scattered all over the world, but there's a mysterious connection between them.
;If you draw a line on the world map between all the ruins you've been to so far, it somehow forms a huge image of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan.

;Neil: Right. Beyond that, the Tower of Babel that Tim's dad was said to have disappeared in,

;Lillie: Well, now that you mention it, there's been a new red star underneath Cygnus as of late…
;Neil: Exactly...! You know a lot, don't you?
;Between the new star appearing in Cygnus and Tim's talk of ruins,
;these various elements are tied together too neatly for it to happen organically...
;I don't know if it's coincidence or conspiracy, but the fact is that something is going to happen.
;However, the circumstances are good. The desert of the Nazca lines is at most a day's walk to the east from here.
