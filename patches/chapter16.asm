widestring_05DDDF `[TPL:2][TPL:B][NAM:2]: How can you say[N]something like that…!? You[N]should be able to word it[N]better…!![FIN]Come on, it's a wonderful[N]nose-irritating smell[N]drifting through the room[N]or something, right?[END]`

widestring_05DA04 `[TPL:6][TPL:A]Neil: Hey! You two little[N]ladies are both terribly[N]blunt, aren't you.[FIN][TPL:B]The thing is, you come not[N]to care about your[N]appearance when you're[N]focusing on inventing.[FIN]But I suppose I thought[N]that people wouldn't hate[N]my odour that much…[FIN]It still hasn't even been[N]past a month since I[N]started wearing these[N]socks.[END]`

widestring_05E0C1 `[TPL:1][TPL:9][NAM:1]: You said it was[N]Cygnus?![FIN][TPL:6][TPL:B]Neil: Right. Beyond that,[N]the Tower of Babel that[N][NAM:0]'s dad was said to have[N]disappeared in,[FIN]…ends up being exactly in[N]the middle of that giant[N]swan.[END]`

widestring_05DE46 `[TPL:2][TPL:B][NAM:2]: Well, now that you[N]mention it, there's been a[N]new red star underneath[N]Cygnus as of late…[FIN][TPL:6][TPL:B]Neil: Exactly…! You know a[N]lot, don't you?[FIN]Between the new star[N]appearing in Cygnus and[N][NAM:0]'s talk of ruins,[FIN]these various elements are[N]tied together too neatly[N]for it to happen[N]organically…[FIN]I don't know if it's[N]coincidence or conspiracy,[N]but the fact is that[N]something is going to[WAI][N]happen.[FIN]However, the circumstances[N]are good. The desert of[N]the Nazca lines is at most[N]a day's walk to the east[WAI][N]from here.[FIN][::]Will you check it out?[N][PAL:0] Yes[N] No`

widestring_05DF9F `[CLR][PAL:4][LU1:36][N][LU1:D]say that. [N][LU2:1]I [LU1:F1]to go. [FIN][JMP:&widestring_05DE46+M]`
