;Tim: D-dad…! Why are you in a form like that…!?
;The Tower of Babel is a mysterious space. The interior is full of the comet's light.
;Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anybody inside evolves at a terrific rate…
;Tim: Then, how are Karen and I able to survive…?!
;Tim's father: That is because you two are evolved humans as well.
;Karen: We are…?
;Tim's father: In the distant past, having possession of biotechnology which used the light emitted from the comet,
;people used its power to create plants and animals as they desired.
;For example, the camel can survive for a long time without food or water because they were made as animals for riding through the desert.
;Soon, humans realized that this power could be used to create weapons, and so they gradually produced demons.
;Suddenly, the world was at the risk of being destroyed…
;At that time, the Warrior of Light and Darkness was produced by the fate of mankind; the possible extermination or survival of humanity. 
;That is your ancestor.
;And the 6 Mystery Dolls will surely produce the Warrior of Light and Darkness.
;Well, I'll entrust in you the fated final Mystery Doll.
