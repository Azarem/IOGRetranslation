;An aged corpse lies quietly...
;At that moment, a familiar voice spoke in my head.
;Tim. It's me. Your father Allman.
;My body has totally rotted away, but I still live on like this...

;Tim: D-dad...! Why are you in a form like that...!?
;The Tower of Babel is a mysterious space. The interior is full of the comet's light.
;Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anybody inside evolves at a terrific rate...
;Tim: Then, how are Karen and I able to survive...?!
;Tim's father: That is because you two are evolved humans as well.
;Karen: We are...?
;Tim's father: In the distant past, having possession of biotechnology which used the light emitted from the comet,
;people used its power to create plants and animals as they desired.
;For example, the camel can survive for a long time without food or water because they were made as animals for riding through the desert.
;Soon, humans realized that this power could be used to create weapons, and so they gradually produced demons.
;Suddenly, the world was at the risk of being destroyed...
;At that time, the Warrior of Light and Darkness was produced by the fate of mankind; the possible extermination or survival of humanity. That is your ancestor.
;And the 6 Mystery Dolls will surely produce the Warrior of Light and Darkness.
;Well, I'll entrust in you the fated final Mystery Doll.

;Tim's father: Ancient people once worshipped the comet as a god.
;A mysterious power dwells in things that are showered in the comet's light, after all.
;Certainly, you could call the comet a god. You could also call it a singular lifeform. But it's a god that no one asked for.
;It advances things too fast, and so only gives birth to destruction...
;As long as there is evil in people's hearts, demons will be born.
;Well, Tim, please focus your eyes and take a look.

;I've become an unaging, undying organism by losing my corporeal body. I've gotten eternal life through evolution by the comet's light.
