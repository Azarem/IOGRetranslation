;An aged corpse lies quietly...

;At that moment, a familiar voice spoke in my head.

;Tim. It's me. Your father Allman.

;My body has totally rotted away, but I still live on like this...

;Tim: D-dad...! Why are you in a form like that...!?

;The Tower of Babel is a mysterious space. The interior is full of the comet's light.

;Time flows at hundreds of times its normal speed; anybody inside evolves at a terrific rate...

;Tim: Then, how are Karen and I able to survive...?!

;Tim's father: That is because you two are evolved humans as well.

;Karen: We are...?

;Tim's father: In the distant past, having possession of biotechnology which used the light emitted from the comet,

;people used its power to create plants and animals as they desired.

;For example, the camel can survive for a long time without food or water because they were made as animals for riding through the desert.

;Soon, humans realized that this power could be used to create weapons, and so they gradually produced demons.

;Suddenly, the world was at the risk of being destroyed...

;At that time, the Warrior of Light and Darkness was produced by the fate of mankind; the possible extermination or survival of humanity. That is your ancestor.

;And the 6 Mystery Dolls will surely produce the Warrior of Light and Darkness.

;Well, I'll entrust in you the fated final Mystery Doll.

;The comet will be very near soon. I must send you both to the tower's rooftop until then. Well, please quietly close your eyes...

;Tim's father: Ancient people once worshipped the comet as a god.

;A mysterious power dwells in things that are showered in the comet's light, after all.

;Certainly, you could call the comet a god. You could also call it a singular lifeform. But it's a god that no one asked for.

;It advances things too fast, and so only gives birth to destruction...

;As long as there is evil in people's hearts, demons will be born.

;Well, Tim, please focus your eyes and take a look.

;Karen: …

;Neil's father: Hey... What in the world is Neil doing…?

;That brat should be making the Reuleck Corporation larger and larger.

;I've become an unaging, undying organism by losing my corporeal body. I've gotten eternal life through evolution by the comet's light.

;But what meaning could there possible by in a life without end? I guess I felt more fulfilled when I was a person living in fear of an incurable illness..

;Morris: Hey Tim, it's been a long time.

;I can't believe that a world like this exists... I guess I could probably have become a scholar if I announced this at an academic conference.

;Peggy: Squee squee...!!

;Tim: So that's how it is; I guess that without a body, even people and animals are no longer distinct...

;Neil's mother: Even if I can observe the real world, I can't touch it…

;No matter how Neil is suffering, I still can't lend him a hand, can I...

;Tim's father: The time is coming closer and closer.

;Well, everyone. Lend Tim your power!

;When Tim and Karen's hearts laid together, when light and darkness became one, a burgeoning power was born..

;The Warrior of Darkness' ultimate power Firebird dwells here, when the Warrior of Light and Darkness has revived across millennia!

;You two, your fight will change the destiny of the Earth.

;Well, please go. To the comet...!!
