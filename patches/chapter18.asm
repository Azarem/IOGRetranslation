;TRANSLATION (REVISED)

;Mid-air garden

;Tim: A mysterious garden was floating in the skies above Nazca...

;Neil and the others on the ground looked like grains of rice as they ran about every which way.

;Could the Nazca lines possibly have been an airfield for this midair garden?

;Race of the Moon: We meet again, huh? Mweheheheh. If you're hanging around a place like this, you must be a vigorous little boy.

;Race of the Moon: This mid-air garden is our vehicle.

;Four crystal balls are enshrined in the four areas. Go around clockwise and you can get them all. Mweheheheh...

;Race of the Moon: The midair garden's underside and its surface. If you jump down from a cliff, there's still an inverted world is there...

;Found a crystal ball!

;Crystal ball / An objet d'art made of crystal. Works together with the crystal tiles.

;Nothing

;Inserted the crystal ball into the hole!

;When you step on this tile, something makes a sound...

;After defeating the huge bird, you found a Mystery Doll in its corpse!!

;Through the sound of a propeller, Neil's voice echoes from a megaphone!

;Neil: Tiiim...! You're getting too close to the grouuund...!!

;I'll catch you in my aeroplane, so jump down...!!

;Neil: Draaat...! Iâ€¦ I missed...!!

;Karen: Neil you dumb dumb dumb dummy...! Tim's going to die...!!

;Rob: Neil! There's still a little more time before he hits the ground..! Do it one more time...!!

;Neil: Alright! This time for sure, you'll see...!!

;Neil: That was dangerous...

;Karen *Sniffle* *Sniffle*...

;Eric: *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*

;Rob: Karen and Eric, stop cryin'. We saved Tim, after all.

;Lillie: By the waaay, Neil's amazing, isn't he? Having made a thing like this.

;Neil: Haha. Please don't praise me like that.

;Anyway, I'll take you to the next ruin with this.

;If we go by the precedent of the ruins mapping up to the shape of the constellation of Cygnus, the next ruin should be the continent of Mu.

;Neil: Alright, out to the ocean...!!

;The continent of Mu should be sleeping somewhere in this deep blue sea.

;Tim: We barely ejected from the aeroplane...

;Neil is an amazing inventor but his products are always missing something...

;It occurred to me that a prefect person may not exist anywhere.
