;The sky above Babel

;Neil: Well, we're about to arrive. Tim. I guess I should give my regards to your dad.

;Tim: Thank you. You've become an outstanding company president too, haven't you, Neil?

;Eric: Aah. From here on, I guess we won't be able to meet with you for a while.

;When you're finished with what you have to do, come back to the South Cape right away.

;Tim: Thanks. I had fun going on a journey with all of you too.



;Eric: Everyone found something on this journey, haven't they?

;Rob encountered Lillie, and met again with his missing father.

;Neil set his heart on succeeding his parents' company.

;For the first time since she was born, Karen saw the world outside of the castle and travelled it with her own two feet.

;I've done one thing to make use of this opportunity, too. It seems like I've become able to go pee by myself at night...!

;Neil: Hahaha. Typical Eric.

;By the way, I don't think Karen has said anything yet.

;You won't be able to meet with Tim for a while. It's almost a parting statement.

;Karen: Yeah. That's how it is, isn't it...

;Neil: Oops, as I've been talking, we've come up to the Tower of Babel right here.

;Alright, Tim. Is your parachute ready...? Let's go...!

;And so, after a year and a half, I'm going to be standing in the Tower of Babel once again…

;The Tower of Babel was silent. It was as if time had stopped for the past year and a half...

;If I recall, the flute that I'm holding was discovered here.

;It seems that something broke off from my flute…

;T-this is the Crystal Ring that King Edward was obsessed with!

;I had thought it was a decoration on the flute, but it was hidden here...

;Got the Crystal Ring!

;Crystal Ring / A ring that was fit into the flute

;This is definitely the Crystal Ring that King Edward was searching for.

;Wait…

;Tim: Karen!?

;Karen: I'm sorry... When we had been separated just now, I somehow had a feeling that we wouldn't meet again..

;Tim: But Karen, how did you manage to come in here?

;You shouldn't have been able to come without this Crystal Ring...

;Karen: I wonder, could it be this ring that did it…? See, we found it at the Gold Ship of the Inca, didn't we?

;This Crystal Ring's colour is dark blue...

;The ring that Karen is holding is light blue, isn't it...

;I guess that maybe this is what you call light and darkness.

;Tim: I understand... I don't know what will happen, but don't leave my side.

;The comet emits an intense light that has a large influence on how living things develop.

;Living things evolved to this point over many, many years.

;Trilobites gave birth to fish; reptiles, mammals gave birth to humanity.

;And humanity will continuously evolve more and more from here.

;From ancient times, the comet has been called both a star of the gods and a star of the devil.

;But the comet that is now approaching the Earth is the star of the devil…

;That star is highly conscious, and it manipulates the Earth's evolution according to its own will...

;The way time advances is different inside of the Tower of Babel... Time flows with hundreds of times its normal speed.

;If you can survive here, you two aren't normal humans, are you…?

;In the room there, monsters made using the light of evolution are sleeping. If you're going to the floor above, lay them to rest...

;Oh, Karen isn't here... Where did she go...?

;You are a human revived to save the Earth. Alright, I'll carry you to the floor above.

;The comet will pass by the Earth's immediate vicinity soon. Well, until then, to the Tower of Babel's peak...

;Tim: Karen...! Where did you go...!?

;Karen: It was because the vampire woman showed up, and we talked...

;She said that her body cannot die for all of eternity...

;But she could rest in peace if only the comet were to vanish.

;If you advance from this point, you will no longer be able to return...

;I'll transport you if you want to return to Dao, but what will you do? / Cancel / Return to Dao

;The comet is approaching... So the final battle is approaching..

;This will even be the last time that I talk with thee like this.

;Thy power has revived to the point where it rivals the comet, Dark Gaia; thou hast grown into a magnificent Warrior of Darkness.

;When thy heart becomes one with the Warrior of Light, Firebird will be revived; the power that only Shadow holds.

;Thou alone canst restore this planet to its original form. I will entrust all my hopes to thee...
