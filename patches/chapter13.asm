;Capital of Flowers, Freesia

;Capital of Flowers, Freesia

;Karen: Wow, it's so pretty...! Isn't it just what you'd expect a place called the Capital of Flowers to be...!!

;I think that the people that live in a beautiful place like this will definitely have beautiful hearts too...

;Man: Hey, there's some more terribly cute travellers. Have you decided on lodging for this evening?

;Karen: No, we haven't decided. Beyond that, we're looking for some people.

;Man: Is that so, how about that? In that case, how about basing your manhunt inside our inn?

;Karen: It's all settled then...! I was already getting worried...!!

;Karen: Tim, you're okay with this too, right...? Well, let's go, let's go...!!

;Karen: That's what the innkeeper here said. Well, let's go in...!!

;Well, please, come in, come in.

;Lillie: Welco-

;Tim and Karen...?!

;Karen: Lillie? Is that Lillie...?!

;Lillie: I was worried...! We've had been split up for nearly a month, after all!!

;I'm been employed as a live-in worker for this innkeeper.

;Rob is in the room on the right, so I'll go there with you...

;Karen: Although we were about to say that we had finally met safely, this is how it is...

;Rob: They say I don't know who I am. What a mystery it is...

;Although I don't know who I am, why am I here?

;Lillie: When Rob was escaping from the Incan ship, he hit his head, and that's how...

;The doctor he saw said that it was temporary amnesia.

;Until Rob gets better, I think he'll be treated in this town, but...

;Lillie: And more than that. I haven't seen any sign of Eric since yesterday evening.

;How did this happen…?

;Don't worry; despite what you'd think, I haven't been robbed.

;Do you think I don't look like I'd be such a disordered person?

;Tim: It seems like this house is locked...

;This town hasn't been full of travellers recently... Business is bad.

;Good grief, when those jerks on the second floor are acting like that... I… I feel inadequate.

;M-my girl friend was helping me get something out of my eye... Hahahahahahahaha.

;I was just helping my boy friend take something out of his eye. Hohohohohohohoho.

;Flowers are becoming the symbol of this town we call Freesia. The town smells wonderful, right?

;I'm not going to lie to you. For your own sake, don't go in the side streets.

;Just as there are thorns on a beautiful rose, there's another side to a beautiful town.

;I'm now looking after 9 Red Jewels for you.

;Whoops, the number of jewels you've collected have passed 8, haven't they...! Going by the list, I'll give you Life Force.

;This should increase your endurance by one.

;With this, I think the number of jewels should have become 11 altogether.

;Your diving act gave me goosebumps; I'm going to give you a nice reward for showing it to me.

;Thwack...!!

;You brat...! Try pulling this kind of dangerous stunt next time...! I'll make you regret it...!!

;What we call motherhood is being unable to hide your worries.

;Are they hanging around in a bad crowd, are they injured somewhere, or something like that, you know...?

;I guess that I've come to worry just like my mom.

;Man's voice: If you value your life, go home...!!

;Whee... *Hic*... Living your life seriously, or living your life drinking or laughing, you know?

;Found a jewel of HP (endurance)!

;Damn it, where the hell did he go..

;A slave escaped. You haven't noticed him anywhere, have you? / Yes / No

;What did you say!? If you tell me where they are, I might be so kind as to give you a Red Jewel. / Inform him / Smile and lie

;However, Tim doesn't know where the slave is hiding.

;Man: Hey... Little boy... Don't make fun of adults...!!

;This isn't a place for kids. Go home, go home.

;I do performance art with fire and I’m the best at what I do. Come on, take a look...!

;After this, we're going to be taken from this place to be sold...

;I don't think about anything. When I think, all I can think about is dying…

;I don't believe in God. If God existed, the world shouldn't have things like social status…

;This brat...! Where did you come in here from...?! Alright, go home, go home...!!

;Girl: There's a boy that worked as a live-in worker at the inn; it seems like a slave merchant detained him.

;I guess there's no way around having someone find us. The person here is the slave that escaped yesterday.

;It's okay to tell the slave merchants. I'm more than ready.

;I'm begging you! Please overlook this...!!

;Whatever happens to me is fine, but you'll inconvenience this person...

;Tim informed them of the house where the slave is hiding.

;Man: Hey, thanks. Here's your reward. Hang on to it.

;Tim received a Red Jewel.

;"From the sky will come a great King of Terror... Then humanity will die out."

;I don't know where the prophesy comes from, but it's straight up lie. I can go on without drinking up that sort of hogwash. *Hic*

;I think "what if my life turned out like theirs" and shudder.

;But I'm going to put all my energy into my own survival right now rather than concerning myself with the feelings of other people.

;These slaves are almost exactly the same age as you, huh?

;I guess you'll remember this. In this world, even people who are the same age as you are living like this.

;Hey boy...! This isn't a place for children! Alright, go home, go home!!

;Or, are you saying that you came to buy a slave too? / Yes / No

;I'm starting to like your courage! I don't know if you're really buying or what, but take a look.

;I'm Ihmuus. I was brought to this town from a distant continent by ship.

;We're a nation of hunters; we survive by hunting when we're hungry.

;Recently, all the animals are dropping dead from a disease with no known cause...

;I'm Rehmuus. When there were no longer any animals, we no longer had food.

;And so, having no other options, we became what you call "slaves" in order to survive.

;We won't have any idea at all of what kind of person will buy us or what kind of place they'll bring us to...

;I'm Sahmuus.

;A boy named Eric that works at the inn came to save us last night.

;But the slave merchants found him and took him away…

;He's probably locked up in the house at the edge of the city's side street. Please save him for me somehow.

;With this, I think the number of jewels should have become 12 altogether.

;Whoops, the number of jewels you've collected have passed 12, haven't they...! Going by the list, I'll give you Strength Force.

;With this, your attack power should rise by one.

;Ho ho ho. You understand this place well, don't you?

;I'm thinking it's fine one way or another, but the truth is that it might have been important enough... That's how it is in this world.

;This is a bonus. Take it.

;The old man stealthily inserted something into Tim's possessions!

;Ho ho ho…

;Tim: Isn't there a boy in there named Eric?

;Man's voice: I don't think I've ever heard of a name like that. Do you have any evidence that of that sort of thing?

;Tim...? That voice is Tim, right...? Help m- *Twhack*

;Man's voice: Shh... Little boy, can't you keep quiet…?

;Tim: (There's no way around it; I'll break down the door...)

;Eric: I can't believe it; you came to save me...!!

;But I didn't think you'd come by breaking down the door.

;The man from just now got surprised and escaped.

;I snuck into a forced labour camp to save those three slave brothers.

;Then they found me and it turned out like this...

;It looks like all of the slaves are being put to work in a diamond mine.

;I'll tell you where it is, so go and save them.

;Tim learned the location of the mine!
