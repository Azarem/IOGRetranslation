;TRANSLATION (REVISED)


;O God.. Why did you create that thing called "social status"?

;I'm now taking care of 15 Red Jewels from you.

;With this, I think the number of jewels should have become 16 altogether.

;Power of Darkness / :Psycho Dash / Psycho Dash / Bodychecks the enemy. There are also obstacles that can be destroyed.

;Memory Melody / Memory of melodies learned from the enslaved boy. Seems to awaken memories.

;Eric: Even though you could say I was able to reunite with all of you, I'm not crying tears of joy.

;I suppose that I've run out of tears…

;Tim quietly started to play the Melody of Memories.

;Rob: Where is this...?

;Karen: Somehow I'm feeling very nostalgic...

;Eric: I feel as if I'm in my mom's tummy...

;Lillie: All of the people that I've ever met and all of the events I've ever experienced from when I was born are floating to the surface of my mind one by one…

;Rob: I was raised in tha town o' South Cape

;But didn't my old man go out on an expedition and not come back...?

;Tha largest existence within me had passed on, and I suppose that I didn't know what to do…

;Karen: I couldn't stand my father invading other countries with his troops.

;It's a terrible thing when people die, isn't it?

;Years of life which had they had built up are reduced to nothingness in an instant.

;Eric: I wonder if Morris ultimately has died too...?

;Lillie: They say that people can forget unpleasant things in order to survive, don't they…?

;Rob: Huh? What have I been doin' until now?

;Why are ya all over there?

;Lillie: Rob! You've got your memory back...!

;Karen: Geez! You know, we were worried about you!!

;Eric: I had no idea what was going to happen…

;Rob: I guess I made everyone worry. But if someone else ends up in tha same position next time, I'll take care of them.

;Karen: I'm crying for some reason.

;Lillie: You really have varied experiences if you go on a journey...

;Eric: You know what. There is apparently an eccentric inventor in a nearby forest; won't you try to meet him?

;Apparently it's a person named Neil, but...

;Tim: You said it's Neil?!

;My cousin went missing; he had the same name...!!

;My cousin Neil is also an inventor. He invented a vehicle that can fly through the big blue sky like a bird; it's called an aeroplane.

;Thus, Tim's party headed to the house of the inventor in the forest.
