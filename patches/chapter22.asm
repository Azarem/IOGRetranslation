;TRANSLATION (REVISED)


;Neil: I guess we've finally arrived. I think we were walking in the undersea tunnel for about a month in the end...

;Rob: Huh? There's a bulletin board.

;Rob: Let's see here. Fallen angel clan? Travelers, please use this room?

;Neil: So the people living in this place are called the fallen angel clan..

;Neil: I guess they put up that sign because they don't want to meet people themselves.

;Before anything else, shall we try to get some rest in that room…?

;Lillie: Tim. Let's go…

;Karen: What is this "Tim, let's go"...!

;You too, Tim! You're flirting.

;I'm going sightseeing alone! Don't come with me...!!

;Lillie: What is she so touchy about...

;Rob: Geez, always tha fickle little lady. Leave her alone, I guess.

;Travelers, please use this room. / Fallen angel clan

;Entrance to fallen angel's town

;Rob: Tim. Tha thing is, I've got somethin' to discuss with ya...

;I hate to say it, but it seems like I've developed feelin's for Lillie...

;Even when I dream, I only dream o' her... Before I knew it, she had caught my eye.

;Ya think that's not like me, right? / Yeah... / That isn't true

;Tim: That's right. I've never thought that you'd be saying things like that.

;Tim: But by you've spent a lot of time together by now. It wouldn't be unnatural even to be in love with her.

;Rob: Speakin' o' that. It seems like Lillie's fifteenth birthday is comin' up soon.

;I want to tell her my feelin's with a present then, but what do ya think I should go with?

;A pretty bouquet / A wonderful necklace / A tender kiss

;Tim: I don't think there's a girl out there who wouldn't be happy to get a bouquet of flowers.

;Rob: I guess that's expected. Well, I think I can try to communicate a love confession through tha language of flowers; rosebuds.

;Rob: Thanks fer lending me yer advice.

;I'll try to think of it in my own way. Good friends are nice to have, ain't they.

;Lillie: The people that call themselves the fallen angel clan live in a gloomy place like this, huh. It's seems depressing…

;Eric: Sunlight is iiincredibly bright. Even though I've always had it around, I hadn't noticed.

;Neil: I had been thinking, mustn't the fallen angel clan be the descendants of the Mu people?

;This is the fallen angels' village. Our bodies are weak; we'd die even if we were in the sunlight for too long.

;There are stories that say we evolved from humans.

;A short time ago, a human girl came here; her name was Karen or something like that.

;It seems that she went to the studio of the artist, Ishtar. His paintings are praised for their beauty, you know?

;I'll teach you the route to the studio, so remember it, alright?

;First of all, follow the wind. You'll understand if you look at which direction the flames of the torches are bending in.

;You can hear the sound of a waterfall where the strong wind storms through the dark passage.

;Subsequently, please examine the area where the waterfall's sound is the loudest.

;Ishtar's studio is beyond there. Be careful, alright?

;This is something called "dance"; a way that humans amuse themselves.

;We want to get closer to human emotions, so we dance like this every day. Even so, nothing changes...

;The picture attached to that wall was painted by an artist called Ishtar.

;However, the models for his pictures go missing afterward...

;Though we lack emotions, Ishtar draws us overflowing with human kindness.

;There is no end to the people who want Ishtar to draw them even though they don't know what will happen to them afterward.

;The person who was my dance partner is now inside of that painting.

;We don't know from what era we started living here.

;But our chests hurt for some reason when we see the ocean.

;We have no emotions...

;We never laugh or cry from the day we are born. In our lives, every day is the same...

;Woman playing the harp: Music is the greatest medicine for the soul.

;No matter what disease you face, you will become well if you hear a wonderful composition.

;I'm now looking after 22 Red Jewels from you.

;Whoops, the number of jewels you've collected have passed 20, haven't they...! Going by the list, I'll give you Psycho Power.

;This is a mysterious, otherworldly power that I will award you from my soul.

;It seems like the Psycho Dash's attack power rose.

;But you aren't holding any jewels. I'll just hold your feelings for you instead.

;Psycho Slider / Performs a sliding attack. Can pass through narrow passages.

;I'm a sculptor. Before I die, I intend to make a thousand of these statues...

;Tim: They have no consciousness, as if their soul had been removed...

;Do you know the painter, Ishtar? / Yes / No

;In that case, you should listen a little more to what everyone has to say.

;The studio of Ishtar, the painter, is on the other side of this door.

;But there are creatures with nothing but hatred and a desire for destruction that are squirming from beyond this point.

;If you say you still want to go despite that, you may open the door.
