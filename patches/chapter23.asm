;It seems like wind is blowing in from a crack in the wall.

;Found a hidden passage!

;The entrance is small; you can't pass though!

;Tim: A picture of Karen. Has she been absorbed into this…?

;Ishtar: You came to take back that girl, haven't you? She was named Karen or something.

;You should go to the rooms ahead of here in that case. If you can solve all of the mysteries, I'll restore that girl to normal.

;Ishtar's apprentice: You can pass when you solve the mystery of the room before you.

;Ishtar's voice echoes.

;Carefully memorize the state of that room.

;When you think you have it completely memorized you may leave the room.

;Indicate the place that differs from the previous room before you.

;That's correct!! You've noticed that the jar's colour was different, haven't you.

;Very good. You may advance to the next room.

;That door was already been opened. It isn't necessary to open it again.

;Carefully memorize the state of that room.

;When you think you have it completely memorized you may leave the room.

;Ishtar's voice echoes.

;Indicate the place that differs from the previous room.

;That's correct!

;Very good. You may advance to the next room.

;Ishtar's voice echoes.

;Carefully memorize the state of that room.

;When you think you have it completely memorized you may leave the room.

;Found a Medicinal Herb!

;Ishtar's voice echoes.

;Indicate the place that differs from the previous room.

;That's correct!! You've realized that the treasure chest's contents are different, haven't you.

;Very good. You may advance to the next room.

;Found a Red Jewel!

;Carefully memorize the state of that room.

;When you think you have it completely memorized you may leave the room.

;Ishtar's voice echoes.

;Indicate the place that differs from the previous the room.

;That's correct!! Your hair was fluttering because the wind was blowing, wasn't it.

;You have passed my tests splendidly. Alright, you may return.

;Ishtar: I had been waiting for you to come.

;You should sprinkle this magic powder over the picture of that girl, then give it a heartfelt kiss.

;Something should happen if you truly feel for that girl. Well, you'll probably understand eventually.

;I painted my own self-portrait. I will soon be assimilated into the picture...

;That girl... Protect her carefully...

;…

;Found the magic powder!

;Magic powder / Magic powder which releases people who have been absorbed into a picture.

;Tim: I need to sprinkle the magic powder to start with...

;Tried using the magic powder.

;Sprinkled the magic powder on the picture of Karen!

;Tim: I'm begging you. Karen... Please return to your original form...

;Tim placed a heartfelt kiss on Karen's picture...

;Karen: Tim... I'm sorry for being selfish...

;Tim: Agh, you've been terrible...! You've been incredibly bad...!!

;Are you so irresponsible that you're willing to cause trouble for other people...!?

;Karen: …

;Karen: Waaaaaaaaaaah! *Sob*... *Sniff*...

;I... *Sob* I don't even know.. why I'm doing it myself... *Sniff*...

;The thing is, when I was in the castle... I got everything that I wanted...

;But since I've been on this journey, it's been totally different...

;Tim: Isn't it obvious...!? When you're only thinking of yourself, you're in trouble when things get serious…!!

;Karen: That's not it...!

;Even when you're far away, I feel that you're close, and even when you're close to me I feel that you're far away...

;If you don't understand, that's fine...

;But I don't think I'll forget what happened today for the rest of my life...

;Neil: Karen! I was worried...!!

;Lillie: Why do you always run around by yourself...!?

;Don't you have any concern for anyone else...!?

;Karen: If you're talking about that, Tim already scolded me.

;Because of that, I sincerely apologize to everyone...! *Bow*…

;Neil: Well, it seems that even the perpetrator understands the matter, so I can tolerate it.

;Anyway, it seems that if we proceed about three days to the south, you get to the Floating City.

;I think we'll try to leave right away. Talk to me when you're prepared to leave.

;Eric: Ah, speaking of that. In the fallen angels' village, I noticed something that looked like a Red Jewel.

;Neil: Is it okay to go? / Yes / Wait a bit

;Neil: Don't rush things. Take your time finishing your business.

;Lillie: Karen seems to be strange somehow, doesn't she…?

;I have a sense about these things; was something wrong with Karen?

;Rob: I suppose that Lillie's birthday will come when we're in the Floatin' City…

;Karen: You know, they say that there are a lot of houses built on rafts in the place that they call the Floating City.

;It's kind of romantic, isn't it? I think it's fun…

;Neil: It seems that the Floating CIty is a considerably hot place.

;Everyone mustn't get heatstroke, so take care.
