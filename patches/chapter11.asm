;TRANSLATION (REVISED)


;Karen: You finally came to, huh. We were split up from everyone...

;Are you hurt? / I'm fine / I'm still dizzy

;Karen: Is that so? It seems like you recover quickly, huh. You're like a lizard's tail.

;I've read stories of being adrift in books, but I would have thought it ridiculous that it would turn out like this for me.

;I guess that disaster comes around suddenly, huh.

;Karen: You know, I can't help but worry.

;Oh, you know, if we don't think about the future, we could enjoy being adrift…

;I'm starving already. Let's have the meat we took from the castle's basement for lunch.

;Quietly started to play the Wind's Melody.

;However, nothing happened.

;We bit into the bone-in meat.

;We felt that it was the tastiest thing we had ever eaten.

;2nd day adrift

;Karen: It's beautiful... Even though I'm watching it all day, I don't think I'm getting tired of it...

;Karen: How could you do that...! Those poor fish...!!

;Tim: Time passed slowly and uneventfully.

;Karen leisurely viewed the fish all day long, but as for me, well, I was full of remorse.

;I don't know how many times I paced aimlessly around the raft and tried talking to Karen.

;A single minute felt like hours. It felt like I could hear the footfalls of an entirely carefree time coming.

;4th day adrift

;Karen: Somehow I have a hunch... That rescue might be coming...

;Oh...?

;Karen: It looks like something is drifting this way...!

;Someone placed a letter into this jar... It read something like this.

;We have been placed on a slave ship; it is heading to unfamiliar land where we will be sold.

;If anyone reads this letter, please save us... / Sahmuus

;Karen: Ah, although I had that hunch…

;They were saying "save us"... But we also want to be saved, right?

;Ah, I'm totally famished already…!

;Tim: And that's why it would have been better if we had eaten some fish last time they were around. So next time...

;Karen: You can't kill cute fish like that!

;Tim: Well then, are you saying it's fine if don't eat anything and die...!?

;Karen: The point is, I can't eat raw fish! It's gross!

;Besides, the fish are trying as hard as they can to survive...!

;The fish feel pain...! Do you think about how the fish feel...?!

;If you want to eat something like that, go ahead and eat it...! Because I'm not going to...!

;If anyone reads this letter, please save us...

;Karen: …

;Tim: That day, Karen wouldn't even give me the sound of her voice...

;Geez, the little lady is a nuisance. Good grief...

;7th day adrift

;Tim: First week adrift. We came upon a school of fish for a second time.

;I'm already at the limit of my strength. I thought that if I didn't eat now, I'd die...

;Karen: …

;Tim... I'm sorry for speaking like that yesterday...

;I'll try to eat a fish too. Because if I die, there's nothing more that I can do, right?

;It's only in comfortable times where you're able to avoid eating foods that you dislike, huh…

;Tim: Allllright. Well, I'll get a fish for you. The tastiest one.

;Tim: Karen ate the delicious-looking fish.

;It seemed like I had come to take a tiny bit of concern about Karen...

;12th day adrift

;Karen: The stars are beautiful, huh...

;It seems like I could touch them with my hands if I was a little taller.

;I think Lillie, Rob and the rest must also be looking at this same starry sky.

;If we could talk with the stars, then we would definitely know where everyone is...

;Karen: Oh, that's right. I noticed recently that there's one more star around the constellation of Cygnus, the swan.

;See, that red star over there.

;Hey. Won’t you make a wish on that star? I feel like it will definitely come true.

;Tim, you close your eyes tight and make a wish too, okay?

;Tim: I tried praying as hard as I could for everyone's safety, and for my dad...

;18th day adrift

;Karen: It's already nearly three weeks since we went adrift, huh?

;Speaking of it, Tim, hasn't your hair grown a little? Yeah, about two pixels. (Laughs)

;Tim: Saying that, Karen, you don't feel like a princess anymore.

;I think if someone said you were a girl from some island, I wouldn't even know.

;Karen: You're awwwfulll!

;W-what...? What's out there in the water...?

;Karen: They're just circling round and round the raft; they're not coming to attack...

;Tim: Let's observe the situation for a bit.

;Karen: Could they be sharks...?

;I wonder if we'll be eaten... What should we do...? Tim…

;Karen: I've got it! These little fishies aren't hungry!

;My butler taught it to me a long time ago. Humans are the only living thing that attack when they're not hungry.

;Tim: If that's the case, then I guess what we're doing is unusual for humans.

;After all, we didn't eat any of the fish until we were about to die, right?

;Karen: That's how it is, huh? Ah, it looks like they're leaving. Dear sharks, farewellll...

;21st day adrift

;Karen: Hey, I want to tell you something about myself. When I was at the castle, I liked to look at the setting sun...

;When I saw the setting sun from the castle's halls, it was incredibly, incredibly lovely...

;But, you know. Now I've come to hate it.

;When the sun sets, then the gloomy, frightful darkness comes...

;Because of that, I start to think that I may never be able to see the dawn again..

;But when you're near for me, I can see lovely morning light every day.

;If you're near for me, I feel that even challenging times like these are fun somehow.

;Tim: I must have wanted to say something like that to Karen, yet for some reason the words didn't come out.

;I only nodded and said nothing…

;Tim: Suddenly, my knees buckled; I collapsed and lost consciousness...

;Karen: Tim...! Tim...! What's wrong...!?

;Hold on...! Don't leave me by myself...!!
