;Floating City Watermia

;Floating City Watermia

;We arrived at the Floating City, Watermia. It was a beautiful town made up of rows of houses that were built on rafts.

;Since the townspeople are nice too, we ended up being given accommodations in the house of a friendly young man named Luke.

;And here is Luke's house. He's a kind gentleman who works as fisherman.

;He was going out for a long time on an ocean voyage, so he said that we should use his house in the meantime.

;Karen: Watermia is an amazingly pretty town, but I've heard some unpleasant gossip...

;Something like playing with people’s lives... What was it…?

;I wonder if without exception, beautiful things always have another side. It was like that with the Capital of Flowers...

;Eric: Eheheh. I found something good just now.

;Take a look behind this house. It'll might hurt your conscience a little, but hey...

;Lillie: Hey, by the way, Rob noticed someone he knows in town.

;And it looks like he went looking for them.

;Neil: These houses on rafts are inspiring me for a new invention...

;Luke: Yo. Are you taking a liking to the house? You're free to use it when I go out on my voyage.

;Karen hid her diary here... Read it? / Yes / No

;Day X of month X / It's been a long long road, but we finally arrived the Capital of Water, Watermia.

;I was thirsty along the way, but I endured it. I was developing blisters inside my shoes, but I did my best to bandage them with a handkerchief.

;Maybe I would have just complained before, but I didn't say anything now. I think I've changed dramatically with this journey...

;I've become used to putting in my full effort for the sake of a certain someone. I'm taking a bit of a liking to who I am now.

;I just heard from a townsperson about a legend that's spoken of here.

;"If you make wish while riding a lotus leaf on a full moon night, the person you like will take a close look at you…"

;It's a wonderful legend, isn't it? Can't I can try it out soon...?

;Kyuui kyuui

;Savvas: My dad is an explorer. He's going to come back to us soon, right after he discovers the golden ship...!!

;Nana: We haven't heard news from our dad even though it's already been half a year since we received his last letter...

;It'll be fine so long as he's safe, but...

;An insane old man arrived in this town two years ago. He's only blabbering strange things about the tower of Babel and stuff like that since then.

;Child: A snake bit me when I went to the Great Wall of China before...

;If the snakes around here land their teeth on you even once, they won't easily let go.

;Child: If a snake bites you, run in circles randomly. If you do that they'll plop off.

;Man: They say that a giant centipede called Sand Fanger inhabits the Great Wall of China.

;It seems that its bodily fluids have the power to cure any kind of disease.

;Chinese herbal medicine uses a lot of weird things as ingredients but I don't think I'd drink just insect lifeblood...

;Child: I'll teach you something good.

;Try waiting behind the gambling house, on the right side. A lotus leaf will arrive.

;The so-called "crazy old man" has amazingly white hair but is actually still young.

;I wonder if he saw something that was extremely frightening...

;An old man who went insane lives in a house deep in this town.

;I'm not sure, but I think he participated in the survey of the Tower of Babel by Allman expedition team or something that like that.

;Woman: This is Watermia. It's really easy to move because everyone's houses are on rafts.

;Woman: I'm going to have a baby soon. My husband ended up looking forward to it, so he's diligently working away to support us.

;Man: *cough* *cough* Wh-what? I've only caught a little cold.

;Man: This is Watermia. It's easy to move because everyone's houses are on rafts.

;Child: We drink this water, we cook our rice in this water, we wash our clothes with this water.

;Water doesn't remain in one place. It beautifully moves itself without pause.

;We want to live like water too, you know…?

;This lotus leaf is over capacity. Get another if you want to ride one.

;Man: This animal is called a Krook.

;It's perfect for crossing the desert because it can survive for a long time without drinking or eating.

;Man: This is a gambling house. I guess you must be really trouble for money if you're coming to a place like this even though you're a child...

;As you can see, this is a drinking contest. We're gambling on who will win.

;It's just like gambling with human life. If they make a little mistake in their judgement, they're sent headfirst down the road to hell.

;It's something that humans do within their unconscious mind, isn't it?

;I'm now looking after 27 Red Jewels from you.

;Human life isn't something easy.

;Make sure not to throw your life away with worthless gambling.

;You can try going to the raft floating behind this building if you want to make big money.

;You can get a lot of money even if you only bet a little.

;I guess if you're willing to bet your life, you can get fabulously rich.

;Ugh, ugh...

;Raaaaaagh...! I can still keep going...!!

;Rob's father: Hey, didja know? I just I went exploring with my friends. It was scary, but fuuun!

;Rob: It looks like he may have injured his head...

;I was thinkin' that I had finally met my missing old man, but I guess this is how it is...

;Rob: Tim, wait. I'm going too.

;It's Lillie's birthday party after this, ain't it. We can't be gloomy today.

;Alright, let's head back ta our room.

;Rob: Alright, with everyone present, let's try ta celebrate Lillie's birthday.

;Lillie: Wha...? Wha...? Everyone remembered my birthday...?

;Eric: Isn't it obvious?

;We thought we'd surprise you so we kept it a secret.

;Neil: Hey Karen. Bring that out now.

;Karen: Got it... It's a birthday cake! Neil made it.

;Neil: Hahaha. It's my first time making a cake.

;It was definitely harder than making an aeroplane.

;Lillie: Thank you... Everyone...

;Today, I might be the happiest girl in the world.

;This is how Lillie's modest birthday party began.

;Then, when the party was nearly over...

;Rob: Lillie, hey. I have a little somethin' ta say ta ya; is that okay?

;I'll be waitin' outside.

;Lillie: Huh? What in the world is that about…?

;Lillie: Sorry. I'll head out for a bit.

;Lillie: What is it?

;You don't seem like your usual self. You're acting humble somehow.

;Rob: I guess that's true. I don't seem like myself ta me, either.

;Here's a birthday present. I thought o' various things, but I think this yer favourite, ain't it?

;Lillie: Wow! This is amaaazing! It's a bouquet of roses...!

;Rosebuds... These will bloom into flowers, won't they?

;Lillie: They have a wonderful aroma...

;Thank you. I'm aaamazingly happy...

;Rob: With that... There are words I want ta convey ta ya together with tha present, any way I can.

;Lillie: What?

;Rob: Yeah. Tha words are much more difficult than tongue twisters and stuff like that, but...

;Rob: Lillie... I care about ya a lot...

;Rob: It's okay if ya don't reply immediately…

;But I wanted ta convey my own feelings ta ya...

;Rob: Lillie! Please wait...!!

;Tim: We didn't know that an incident like that had happened at all.

;Lillie didn't come back to our room that day...

;Tim: Then, the following morning…

;When my eyes opened, there was no sign of Rob...

;Karen: I wonder what happened to Rob and Lillie. I'm worried...

;Rob's letter / A letter from Rob addressed to Tim.

;Opened Rob's letter.

;Rob: I'm going ta tha Great Wall o' China fer a little bit.

;I had intended ta keep this a secret from everyone, but I thought I'd only tell you...

;I'll put this letter in yer luggage, but I wonder if you'll notice. I think yer pretty dumb, after all.

;I learned a method ta cure my old man's disease from tha townspeople's stories... It seems like that medicine is at tha Great Wall o' China.

;Tha path is long, but I'll just run it like a marathon and be right back. Don't worry.

;P.S.: Ah, that's right, I nearly forgot... Lillie ended up turnin' me down.

;Every month on a full moon night, people play Russian glass; it's the ultimate form of gambling where you bet your very life.

;But you're still young, little boy. I definitely don't think you should be throwing your life away.
