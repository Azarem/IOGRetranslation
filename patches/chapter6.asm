;Tim: Your piglet came for me...
;Karen: It's named Peggy. Cute, right?

;Bone-in meat / Bone-in meat that was in Edward Castle's basement.

;Tried to nibble the bone-in smoked meat a little bit.

;I had never eaten anything with anything like this mysterious taste. I wonder what in the world kind of meat this is...

;Karen: Alright. We're finally heading out, huh?
;First, let's try to go to your house. You must be worried about the Mrs. Laura and Mr. Bill.
;The two hurried to Tim's house.

;Tim: Wah...! What in the… Why does it look like this…

;Karen: This is awful...! Who could have done something like this…

;Tim: What about Grandma and Grandpa!?

;Karen: Mr. Biiill...!

;Tim: Grandma Lauuura!

;Karen: I'll just quickly look on the second floor…!

;Karen: Eeeeeeek...!! Come here! Help! Tim! It's, it's a disaster, a disaster!

;Tim: What happened!?

;Karen: Look at this wall! This emblem, the mark of a leopard with black fur.. That means Black Panther came here!

;Tim: "Black Panther"...?

;Karen: The assassin that my mother hired recently!

;He's a tenacious, morbid, sinister man.

;If he has someone in his sights once, it's already over... He's a man that with no concern whatsoever about things like human life!

;Tim: Then, Grandpa and Grandma..

;Lillie: You don't have to worry, you two.

;Tim: Ah. It's you, from a while ago...

;Karen: Who are youuu!?

;Lillie: Iii'm Tim's friend.

;Tim: Lillie, do you know something?

;Lillie: It's okay. Grandpa Bill and Grandma Laura are safe too.

;They're hiding in my village.

;Karen: Your village?

;Lillie: The village of the Itory clan.

;Karen: I haven't even heard of a village like that!

;Lillie: Naturally! There's a barrier put up in my village so that normal humans can't see it, you know...?

;Lillie: Alright, let's go, Tim!

;Tim: Sure!

;Karen: I'm coming along too!

;Lillie: Your Majesty would be in danger…

;Karen: I'm definitely coming along with you! That way, I can truly become free...!!

;Lillie: That's just how it is, little lady.

;I feel like some lovely experiences are awaiting us.

;Lillie: Are you going to go and meet with everyone before going to my village?

;It might be a while before we can come back.

;Lillie: Huh...? Are you done already? Or are you going to check on the state of the town for a bit?

;What's the matter, Tim? You're looking at people's faces so closely...

;You're probably scheming something again, huh...?

;With this, I think the number of jewels should have become 7 altogether.

;Whoops, the number of jewels you've collected have passed 5, haven't they...! Going by the list, I'll give you Protection Force.

;With that, your defensive power should rise by one.

;Ugh, it's always me…

;Rob: What's tha matter, Tim? Ya got a sad face.

;Ya havin' some problems that ya can't tell us about?

;Eric: What's wrong? You're different than usual.

;Lillie: Have you decided to head out? / Yes / No

;Karen: I feel like some lovely experiences are ahead of us.

;Lillie: No, from here, there will definitely be a lot of difficulties... *Sigh*...

;Karen: But we'll stand against them one by one, right?

;Lillie: It'll be like that for sure; have you ever been outside the castle?

;Karen: What a crazy girl!

;Lillie: What did you say, you sheltered...!

;Lillie: Tim's my friend. You understand that, right?

;Karen: Ah, you're my friend, right?! / Yeah, of course / I can't so easily know you that well...

;Karen: I'm glad, Tim. Come on, let's hold hands as we go.

;Like this, the three headed to Lillie's village.
