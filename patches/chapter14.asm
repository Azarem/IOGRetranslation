;TRANSLATION (REVISED)


;Diamond Valley

;Diamond mine

;Tim: It had fallen to an eerie silence inside of the mine.

;But the screams of the slaves could sometimes be heard from the direction of the cave's depths, sending shivers down my spine…

;(Entrance to lift platform) Head to the gate there if you're going to the lift.

;There seems to be one keyhole on this gate.

;Myself included, there are eight slaves working in this mine. Please save them somehow.

;Slave: I'm begging you! Please cut this chain!!

;Thank you for saving me. To show my thanks, I'll tell you something good.

;This mine has hidden rooms; their entrances aren't distinct from the walls.

;But a draft blows out of the cracks in the entrances; they say that if you can find them if you pay attention.

;Although, with flowing hair like yours, you'll probably know immediately when it starts to flutter, huh?

;Thank you very much. I was buried alive in a cave-in...

;How would it have turned out if you came just a bit later...

;Please take a modest present from me. I'll send 3 Red Jewel to Mr. Jewel Merchant's location later, okay?

;I am the fountainhead of life, Gaia. I think that I will bestow upon thee one suggestion.

;Enemies that thy sword cannot reach can be defeated with Friedan's power, Dark Fryer.

;If thou defeat all enemies, the road can always be opened.

;Became able to use the Power of Darkness, Dark Fryer!

;Dark Fryer is a Power of Darkness that is only usable by Friedan, the Warrior of Darkness.

;By shooting aura power, thou canst incinerate enemies that are far from thee. Thou canst charge up with the attack button...

;Status / Power of Darkness / :Dark Fryer / This is Friedan's status / An explanation of the selected Power of Darkness will be displayed with the confirm button.

;Dark Fryer / Fires a ball of force from your blade.

;There are people who have been put to work even in the depths of the diamond mine.

;Please use this key and save them somehow.

;Got the lift key!

;Wind's Melody / The melody that the Incan wind plays.

;Lift's key / A key that goes to the boarding platform for the diamond mine's lift.

;Tried using the key to the lift's boarding platform.

;Used the lift platform key!

;You haven't equipped anything…

;There seems to be two keyholes on this gate.

;Corpse storehouse

;Found the key to the mine!

;Mine's key A / The key discovered in the mine's corpse storehouse.

;Slave: T-thank you!! I will never forget this favour.

;Please take this key.

;Got a mine key!

;Mine's key B / The key that was held by the diamond mine's slave.

;Tried using the mine key.

;However, there was no keyhole there!

;You're holding both keys... Will you try inserting them into the keyholes? / Yes / No

;The keys made an eerie sound as they turned.

;Rehmuus / Please cut the chain somehow...!

;Rehmuus: Thank you. We were born in a village from a distant, far away place across the ocean.

;If you ever visit there, please help the villagers.

;Ihmuus: Please cut the chain somehow...!

;Ihmuus: Thank you. In the village where we were born, something strange is happening to all the animals.

;Afterward, we found that other strange things were happening; people turning to stone, even people dying from unknown diseases...

;Sahmuus / Please cut the chain somehow...!

;Sahmuus / Thank you.

;I heard it from Eric; one of your companions is suffering from amnesia, right?

;There is a song that has been passed down in our tribe since long ago which aids memory. Please listen this song.

;Sahmuus hummed a mysterious melody.

;Learned the Melody of Memories!

;Sahmuus: I do have one request...

;I would gladly take the prison key and Wind's Melody so that I can remember meeting you.

;I expect that you probably won't be using them from now, after all.

;I won't forget you for my entire life.

;You aren't holding a flute...
