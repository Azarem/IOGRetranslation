;Karen: That thing that they call is Krook is a weird animal, isn't it…?

;Eric: Today is a full moon night. I think I'm getting the sense that towns always seem to take a different form when things like this happen.

;Neil: A vast desert stands before us if we go to the west from here.

;It isn't possible to cross it on foot. You need to have something like a Krook.

;Now, I wonder what how we can get a hold of some Krooks...

;Lillie: It'll be nice if Rob's father could get well quickly, wouldn't it?

;Rob: I gave tha medicine to my old man just now.

;I think he'll slowly recover after this...

;Woman: A girl wearing pink clothes was making a wish atop the lotus leaf over there just now.

;I'm now looking after 28 Red Jewels from you.

;This is where we meet for Russian glass. Are you participating? / Yes / No

;What, you’re betting your young life on Russian glass...?!

;This isn't a game. You're betting your life.

;I'll ask you one more time. You really won't regret this? / Yes / No

;Very well. The one standing there is the opponent you're competing against.

;He's a veteran of this game. I've never seen a human being with luck like his.

;Alright. You may ask him about the rules.

;Another young life will be reduced to ashes tonight...

;There is no other game as exciting as this. I'm shaking.

;How can you bet your life like this? You're still young.

;You have courage, don't you?

;It seems that your opponent has earned a lot of money through this game. I wonder what in the world he's using it for...

;Competitor: Humph... You haven't even experienced life yet, and you still dare to come here?

;The rules are simple. One of these five glasses has poison placed into it.

;We take turns drinking them. Whoever is left alive in the end is the winner.

;Well, I'll start...!

;Competitor: Raaaaaaaaagh...!!

;The competitor drained the contents of the glass in one gulp...

;Tim: Oh? The drink in the glass looks as though it's dyed with blood...

;Is this because of the power that is dwelling inside my body too...?

;Drink the contents of the glass? / Yes / No

;Tim: I closed my eyes and drained the glass in one gulp!

;Competitor: Humph...! You're damn lucky... I guess it's my turn next.

;Competitor: Hey, it's your turn! Don't lose your nerve and run away!

;Tim: I closed my eyes and drained the glass in one gulp!

;Competitor: This is the one remaining glass...

;Spectator: It's okay now... This boy won...

;Spectator: That's right! Stop it already...!!

;Contestant: No... I have no intention to be left in shame with my tail between my legs…

;The man took the glass in hand...

;Spectator: Put that down and come over here...! It's already your loss..!! You don't need to be in a hurry to die..!

;The man, not listening to the spectators, quickly downed the contents of the glass!

;Woman: You must be the gentleman who was competing in Russian glass, right?

;My husband said that he said he found a good job so I shouldn't worry; I never expected that it would be something like that...

;This is my husband's will. "To my opponent" is written on the cover. Please read it.

;With that, there are four Krooks outside of my house; please use them.

;Woman: We don't need money at all... But they say that true luck is being together someone you care about, don't they?

;Will / The will left over by your Russian glass opponent.

;Gently opened and read the will.

;To my opponent

;Even when I've died, I want you not to mourn. And I want you to not feel down.

;I was knocking on heaven's door even if it wasn't Russian glass that killed me.

;When I was diagnosed with an incurable illness half a year ago, I was thinking that I should put all of my effort into earning money until death comes for me.

;I thought that I shouldn't cause problems for my wife and still unseen child after my death, after all.

;However, the money I earned got unhappiness for other people. I think I'll end it this time...

;If I am defeated in this match, I want to share some of my property with you that has bravery.

;Please adore my four favourite Krooks.

;Karen: They say Neil wasn't born in any old house; his family runs a trading company from their mansion in the town of Euro.

;Eric: Why do we have to part with Rob and Lillie now…?

;Rob: It's my bad fer everyone, but I'm remainin' here. I guess I can't just dump that old man of mine.

;After that... Uh, I guess I'm feelin' shy or somethin'...

;The thing is, I'm goin' out with Lillie.

;These feelin's ain't fer play, of course. I want us ta be together fer a while.

;And Lillie says that she wants ta stay together too.

;It was fun goin' out on a journey with everyone. I pray that yer journey is successful.

;Lillie: I'm also remaining in this town.

;As for the reason.. Well, ask Rob.

;Neil: I think that the moment where a boy and a girl develop feelings for each other is wonderful and magical.

;I want to believe that we'll never forget this feeling.

;Anyway. My parents' house is in Euro, isn't it? I think we'll familiarize ourselves with Tim's power somehow if we go there.

;Alright, let's head out to Euro...!!
