;Welcome to my mansion.
;Gem the jewel merchant was a temporary form. My true form is called Solid Arm.
;I was beaten by Soul Blader back when he descended from the heavens; after that, I slept for a long, long time...
;My power was sealed in Red Jewels which were scattered throughout the world.
;So, I did whatever I could to have myself resurrected.
;I was even the one on the other side of the curtain, pulling the strings of the slave trade.
;I used slave labour to search for the jewels, but I didn't think I would take back my power so quickly...
;As my thanks to you, I'll let you rest in peace!
