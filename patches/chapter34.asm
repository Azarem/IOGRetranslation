;I'm now looking after 49 Red Jewels from you.

;With this, I think the number of jewels should have become 50 altogether.

;50... Finally, I've gathered the 50 Red Jewels, haven't I...

;It seems that, at last, the time to tell you my secret has come.

;Well, come with me...!!

;When I came to, I was standing at the entrance of a mysterious mansion.

;Welcome to my mansion.

;Gem the jewel merchant was a temporary form. My true form is called Solid Arm.

;I was beaten by Soul Blader back when he descended from the heavens; after that, I slept for a long, long time...

;My power was sealed in Red Jewels which were scattered throughout the world.

;So, I did whatever I could to have myself resurrected.

;I was even the one on the other side of the curtain, pulling the strings of the slave trade.

;I used slave labour to search for the jewels, but I didn't think I would take back my power so quickly...

;As my thanks to you, I'll let you rest in peace!

;Tim: When I came to, I found that I had collapsed in a familiar place. Was I having a nightmare..?

;I can hear a faint voice...

;It has been done once again..

;Soul Blader was strong too, but I think you are even stronger...

;Danger is approaching this planet. Well, you should return to the Tower of Babel and hurry on...
