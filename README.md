## 1.) What is This Patch?

What started out as a project to create a baserom for editing Illusion of Gaia expanded into a retranslation. Which then expanded into something of a remaster. It's now growing into kind of a definitive edition. While the game can be played to completion with all new additions as-is, the retranslation script will not be considered complete until **Patch 2.0**. New features are regularly released in patch updates and bug testing is welcome. Please feel free to follow the journey and join the discussion in the [GaiaLabs Discord](https://discord.gg/y6pWtyD5).

☄ Various bug fixes.  

### **Patch Notes (v1.0)**

☄ New Translation by L Thammy!  
☄ When starting a game, the options menu now offers the choice between the North American localized names (Will, Lance, Seth, etc.) or original Japanese ones (Tim, Rob, Morris, etc.). This option replaced the choice between Stereo and Mono. Stereo is now enabled by default.

☄ Now there's a Sprint Button! You can also still sprint using a double-press on the D-pad. This can definitely be considered an accessibility option for those who struggle with or dislike the original method. It also makes Illusion of Gaia play a bit more like its successor, Terranigma.  
☄ Dialogue has been made harder to accidentally skip through. Several button inputs that allowed text to advance were disabled to make this possible.  
☄ Asset decompression allows scenes to load MUCH faster.  
☄ MSU compatibility is included. Instructions for its use can be found in section 2 of this document.  
☄ Sky Deliveryman has been added back into the endgame. Aside from the ability to return to earlier locations in the game, nothing about those areas has been changed at this time.

## 5.) About the Project

In September of 1994, Illusion of Gaia made its North American debut. The story by Japanese sci-fi writer Mariko Ouhara was notable for being much darker than the other RPGs Nintendo was allowing at the time. Despite a softening of the themes, the plot she weaved went to dark and intriguing places and left players with much to think about. Unfortunately, the localization was also often incomprehensible, with transitions between first and third person narrative that were difficult to follow.

Many years later in early 2020, ResetEra forum member L Thammy would spend roughly two months translating the game that has been so special for all of us and shared the experience with the internet. Through ResetEra's forums, and an accompanying series of subtitled YouTube videos, he succeeded in retranslating Gaia Gensouki. The assistance of fellow forum-users made the process a collaborative endeavor and gave us a more accurate translation. The thread and videos are still worth reading and viewing should you be interested in the actual translation process! As of this writing, both can still be found online.

At some point, a spreadsheet was created to compile all of the screenshots, transcription, raw transliteration, revised translation, and contextual comments. L Thammy expressed approval if anyone was willing to use the translation for a patch, but one would not be produced for a little over four years.

The GaiaLabs tool set for Illusion of Gaia ROM hacking hit the scene and its realization finally became possible. Much like L Thammy's Let's Play, Azarem's personal project would be noticed by others with a love for the game and evolve into a collaborative effort that expanded in scope. It took a long time to get here, but the full depth of Mariko Ouhara's "Gaia Gensouki" can be experienced in "Illusion of Gaia Retranslated."

## 6.) Special Thanks

**This section is outdated, but we will update it in the near future!**

Firstly, to L Thammy who graciously allowed us to use his translation as part of the project.

Also, to CDude who has been an active participant in the streams; contributing to creative choices and bug fixes along the way.

To the staff of Quintet, manga creator Moto Hagio, and sci-fi/fantasy author Mariko Ōhara, whose passion and talent made all of this possible in the first place.

Even to Robert L. Jerauld and the Enix USA staff!

Sometimes, we may poke fun at the original translation, but those working in localization at the time often had insufficient resources and were working on tight deadlines. Jerauld reported in a 2014 interview with Heidi Kemps at Gaming Moe, that he "wanted the story to feel natural, the characters to resonate with people, to feel familiar." Considering the love people have shown for Illusion of Gaia, I'd say they did something right!
