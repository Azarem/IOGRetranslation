1.) Application Instructions
----------------------------

This is a BPS patch for Illusion of Gaia which replaces approximately 99% of the original Robert L. Jerauld localization's script with L Thammy's retranslation of Gaia Gensouki. In addition, the patch decompresses all the assets in the game, while providing an expanded ROM with available space. As a result, loading times are extremely fast! A handful of ASM patches are used to modify the loading process to support faster screen transitions by completely bypassing the decompression steps.

Instructions are also included for those who wish to take advantage of the game's newly-added MSU-compatibility. In addition to the new script and higher-quality music, several other additions and improvements have been made to the original localization which can be read about in section 3 of this document, under the title "What's New?".

3.) About the Project
---------------------

In September of 1994, Illusion of Gaia made its North American debut. The story by Japanese sci-fi writer Mariko Ouhara was notable for being much darker than the other RPGs Nintendo was allowing at the time. Despite a softening of the themes, the plot she weaved went to dark and intriguing places and left players with much to think about. Unfortunately, the localization was also often incomprehensible, with transitions between first and third person narrative that were difficult to follow.

Many years later in early 2020, Resetera forum member L Thammy would spend roughly two months translating the game that has been so special for all of us and shared the experience with the internet. Through ResetEra's forums and an accompanying series of subtitled YouTube videos, he attempted and succeeded in retranslating Gaia Gensouki. The assistance of fellow forum-users made the process a collaborative endeavor and gave us a more accurate translation. The thread and videos are still worth reading/viewing, should you be interested in the actual translation process! As of this writing, both can still be found online.

At some point, a spreadsheet was created to compile all of the screenshots, transcription, raw transliteration, revised translation, and contextual comments. L Thammy expressed approval if anyone was willing to use the translation for a patch, but one would not be produced for a little over four years.

The GaiaLabs tool set for Illusion of Gaia ROM hacking hit the scene and its realization finally became possible. Much like L Thammy's Let's Play, Azarem's personal project would be noticed by others with a love for the game and evolve into a collaborative effort that expanded in scope. It took a long time to get here, but the full depth of Mariko Ouhara's "Gaia Gensouki" can be experienced in "Illusion of Gaia Retranslated."
