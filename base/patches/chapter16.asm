widestring_05D9C1 `[TPL:6][TPL:B]Neil: Oh…! Well, if it[N]isn't [NAM:0]…!! I guess[N]you've developed a[N]terribly resolute will.[FIN]With that, the rest of you[N]that are swarming in, are[N]you [NAM:0]'s friends?[END]`

widestring_05DDDF `[TPL:2][TPL:B][NAM:2]: How can you say[N]something like that…!? You[N]should be able to word it[N]better…!![FIN]Come on, it's a wonderful[N]nose-irritating smell[N]drifting through the room[N]or something, right?[END]`

widestring_05DA04 `[TPL:6][TPL:A]Neil: Hey! You two little[N]ladies are both terribly[N]blunt, aren't you.[FIN][TPL:B]The thing is, you come not[N]to care about your[N]appearance when you're[N]focusing on inventing.[FIN]But I suppose I thought[N]that people wouldn't hate[N]my odour that much…[FIN]It still hasn't even been[N]past a month since I[N]started wearing these[N]socks.[END]`

widestring_05DB1C `[TPL:6][TPL:A]I guess two years have[N]passed since meeting with[N]you, huh?[FIN]Since then, I've made some[N]terribly varied[N]inventions.[FIN]In this room, there are[N]just four inventions that[N]I'd like to boast of.[FIN]Search and take a look.[END]`

widestring_05E55C `[TPL:6][TPL:8]That's the camera.[FIN][TPL:B]It's a device that can[N]burn an identical image of[N]the landscape onto[N]photographic paper.[FIN]The flaw is that copying[N]it takes nearly 30[N]minutes.[FIN]The landscape doesn't move[N]so that's fine;[FIN]But people have to go on[N]without even blinking for[N]30 minutes when you're[N]photographing them.[FIN]The image of your eyes[N]ends up turning bright red[N]like a rabbit's when using[N]this device.[END]`

widestring_05DD04 `[TPL:6][TPL:9]Neil: [NAM:0], where are you[N]going?[FIN][TPL:B]You took the trouble of[N]coming here, so relax a[N]while longer before you[N]go.[END]`

Please[N]tell me what you need.[FIN][TPL:0][TPL:B][NAM:0] told Neil about the[N]events that happened until[N]now; hearing the voice of[N]his missing father,[FIN]searching for the [NAM:D][N][NAM:E]s that are spread[N]across ruins throughout[N]the world, and so on.[FIN][CLD][TPL:6][TPL:A]Neil: Hohoho… I think[N]that's a very interesting[N]story…[FIN]I’m a little interested in[N]ancient ruins too, you[N]know?[FIN]The ruins that you've told[N]me are scattered all over[N]the world…[FIN]But there's a mysterious[N]connection between them.[FIN][TPL:B]If you draw a line on the[N]world map between all the[N]ruins you've been to so[N]far…[FIN]…it somehow forms a huge[N]image of the constellation[N]of Cygnus, the swan.[END]`

widestring_05E0C1 `[TPL:1][TPL:9][NAM:1]: You said it was[N]Cygnus?![FIN][TPL:6][TPL:B]Neil: Right. Beyond that,[N]the Tower of Babel that[N][NAM:0]'s dad was said to have[N]disappeared in,[FIN]…ends up being exactly in[N]the middle of that giant[N]swan.[END]`

widestring_05DE46 `[TPL:2][TPL:B][NAM:2]: Well, now that you[N]mention it, there's been a[N]new red star underneath[N]Cygnus as of late…[FIN][TPL:6][TPL:B]Neil: Exactly…! You know a[N]lot, don't you?[FIN]Between the new star[N]appearing in Cygnus and[N][NAM:0]'s talk of ruins,[FIN]these various elements are[N]tied together too neatly[N]for it to happen[N]organically…[FIN][TPL:12]I don't know if it's[N]coincidence or conspiracy,[N]but the fact is that[N]something is going to[N]happen.[FIN][CLD][TPL:6][TPL:9]However, the circumstances[N]are good.[FIN][TPL:B]The desert of the Nazca[N]lines is at most a day's[N]walk to the east from[N]here.[FIN][::]Will you check it out?[N][PAL:0] Yes[N] No[PAL:4]`

widestring_05DF9F `[CLR]Neil: Hey, don't say that.[N]You know, to tell you the[N]truth, I want to go[N]myself.[FIN][JMP:&widestring_05DE46+M]`

widestring_05DFC3 `[CLR]Neil: Alright…! I guess[N]it's settled then.[END]`
